			<descr_partner>Scoured by Ice Age glaciers, the dramatic east coast boasts long, narrow fjords with steep sides and jagged peaks which contrast with inland fertile farmlands. Natural harbours mean picture-postcard fishing villages and seemingly never-ending roads cross the region, providing beautiful sweeping views.  Fjaroabyggo  is an association of villages in the Eastern fjords of Iceland. It includes the towns of Eskifjorour, Faskruosfjorour, Mjoifjorour, Neskaupstaour, Reyoarfjorour and Stoovarfjorour, all tiny fishing villages with steep mountains towering just behind the houses. In this area you will see some of the features that make Iceland a unique place in the world: spectacular fjords with a rich sea life, a great variety of birdlife, and countless breathtaking hiking paths. You will explore the area during your stay in the east.</descr_partner>
			<descr_work>During this workcamp participants will take part in the production of a video documentary which will be focused on how Icelandic people live and survive in isolated rural areas.  It will be a mix of landscape shots and interviews of local people in order to find out how they feel about living there and what they think about international volunteers coming to the village. Another part of the project will be focused on the Auroras Borealis. During this time of the year it is very easy to see and experience this amazing spectacular phenomenon. Volunteers will be involved in a TIME- LAPSE project in order to catch the lights and have a common visual arts project.During this time of the year the weather in Eskifjorour can be very unfriendly and cold. We strongly recommend to bring really warm and waterproof clothes. You should also be aware of the fact that the weather can get so extreme that it  will not allow us to go out of the accommodation. Don t forget to bring your cameras and tripods since big parts of the project are focused on Auroras hunting. The tripod is an essential tool to keep the camera working in a long exposure. You will not be able to enjoy and work in this part of the project without tripod So do not forget it</descr_work>

FoodFood is included for the duration of the workcamp, however everyone is expected to do their fair share of the cooking and cleaning. For the days after and before the workcamp volunteers need to provide their own meals. Since it is always nice to try new and different dishes, volunteers are encouraged to bring along their favorite recipes from home</descr_accomodation_and_food>

			<descr_partner>Hverageroi is a small town of about 1,700 inhabitants that lies some 45 km east of Reykjavik. This friendly little community sits on top of a highly active geothermal field, which provides heat for hundreds of greenhouses where fruit, flowers and vegetables are produced throughout the year. Even bananas grow in these greenhouses The name Hverageroi means  hot springs garden.  Geothermal energy is Hverageroi s lifeblood, and you probably won t find such a natural wonder in the middle of a populated area anywhere else in the world. Nearby you will find an even more geothermally active site: Gufudalur, the lovely  Steam Valley  behind the town. This whole valley is full of hot springs, geysers, mud pots, fumaroles and steaming vents. Our host is the Rehabilitation and Health Clinic, which is a part of the Natural Health Association of Iceland.  Every year approximately 2,000 patients and other guests enjoy their diverse rehabilitation programs, which are focused on an approach that builds self-confidence and personal responsibility for the patients  own health. The Clinic has earned a solid reputation, both in Iceland and internationally, since its foundation in 1955 for personal and effective care of patients. It is the oldest and one of the two most important rehabilitation clinics in Iceland.</descr_partner>
			<descr_work>The Natural Health Association has a horticultural and environmental department, including forestry, gardening, and greenhouses, which is where Worldwide Friends volunteers work most of the time. The nature of the work depends largely on weather conditions, which can change quickly. Volunteers should bring clothes appropriate for outdoor work, but also clothes for working inside the warm greenhouses.</descr_work>

			<descr_partner>The village of Raufarhofn is the community that lies farthest north in Iceland. It is located in the eastern part of Melrakkasletta close to the Arctic Circle. The population of Raufarhofn is about 200 and most of the people there earn their living from fishing and fish processing. The harbor is very beautiful and partly shaped by nature itself. A wide and untouched open area surrounds the village with a lot of birds and varied vegetation. In summer one will observe wild migratory birds within the village being a part of the village life with the villagers most often waking up in the morning to the songs of birds. The coastline with its inlets and creeks is filled with driftwood and reaches out into the Arctic Sea. Away and on the surface of the sea various sea-birds will be spotted and an occasional seal. On the beach waders strut and inland on the grassy moorlands there are dozens of lakes filled with trout. In the vicinity many species of ducks, waders and species that favor heaths and moorlands may be observed.</descr_partner>
			<descr_work>the purpose of this camp is very diverse. During these camp volunteers will be able to cooperate in different tasks. Depending to the season or month where volunteers will participate in the camp the themes will be different. WF owns a center in the village. During the first month of the summer the camp will be more focused on cultural activities for the people and the youth of the village. Activities such as cultural coffees , international evenings, workshop which volunteers can develop, renovation work such us painting and cleaning the House and visual arts project such a sharing photography knowledge s, video filming and editing. During the last 2 months of the summer volunteers will work more on environmental tasks such as cleaning the coast line. During this time the local Youth goes back to school and is more difficult to gather people for cultural evening. Another reason to avoid environmental work during the first 2 months is due to the migrant birds known as CRIA in Iceland. About this time they are nesting and is not good to disturb the areas. At the end of August the fly back again and is perfect time for coastline cleaning. Also during this time volunteers will have the chance to share photo skills and video and edit and produce visual arts materials to be use afterwards on our website.This work camp is a way to enjoy an amazing time in Iceland with other international volunteers and to have an incredible experience where participants share their knowledge with each other while they are exploring creativity, environmental issues and intercultural learning.</descr_work>

			<descr_partner>Reykjavik is a city full of energy, just waiting for you to experience it. Powered by heat from the earth below, with ever-changing weather sweeping across the landscape, its natural features are matched by the energy of its residents.  Think of the qualities of a great city - fun, culture, nature, clean air - and Reykjavik has them in spades. All the advantages of a modern, forward-looking society are complemented by the beautiful natural setting. In a country of only just over 300,000 people, the Reykjavik Capital Area has a population of about 200,000. However, since it s the only major city in the country, Reykjavik has a lot of the amenities that you would only expect to find in a much larger center elsewhere in the world.Reykjavik is the world s northernmost capital city and is centred on the Seltjarnarnes Peninsula. Come at the right time of year, and in favourable conditions you will see the city s skyline silhouetted against the glowing, shimmering curtain of the aurora borealis, also known as the northern lights. Reykjavik is framed by the majestic Mt. Esja and the blue waters of Faxafloi Bay to the north, while rugged lava-fields spread to the southeast. On a clear sunny day, the Snaefellsjokull glacier glitters on the western horizon like a crystal.  In this time of the year when conditions are favourable you can see the Northern lights (Aurora borealis) glowing curtain of  greenish yellow lights, dancing in the distance to a spectacular, multicoloured fusion stretching across the sky.</descr_partner>
			<descr_work>We will live together and create a cosy atmosphere in the area where our office, cultural centre and accommodation are located by putting up lights and Christmas decorations. The main idea of this camp is to celebrate Christmas together and to promote peace and friendship among the group trough intercultural learning and exchange. We will learn Christmas songs from all over the world from each other and weather permitting will sing in the streets of Reykjavik and other public places in town as a sign of peace and multiculturalism. For New Year s Eve we will organize a little party for the volunteers and we will enjoy Reykjaviks spectacular fireworks in front of the cathedral. We will also arrange a visit to the   Imagine Peace Tower  which was designed by Yoko Ono in memory of John Lennon. The tower is made-up of 15 large searchlights surrounded by a number of prisms that act like mirrors, reflecting the light vertically into the sky, usually reaching an altitude of at least 4000 meters. Over half a million written wishes that people from all over the world have sent to Yoko Ono as part of her  Wish Trees  project are buried underneath the tower.</descr_work>

During the second week the volunteers will visit high schools to perform the session.

			<descr_partner>Scoured by Ice Age glaciers, the dramatic east coast boasts long, narrow fjords with steep sides and jagged peaks which contrast with inland fertile farmlands. Natural harbors mean picture-postcard fishing villages and seemingly never-ending roads cross the region, providing beautiful sweeping views.  Fjaroabyggo  is an association of villages in the Eastern fjords of Iceland. It includes the towns of Eskifjorour, Faskruosfjorour, Mjoifjorour, Neskaupstaour, Reyoarfjorour and Stoovarfjorour, all tiny fishing villages with steep mountains towering just behind the houses. In this area you will see some of the features that make Iceland a unique place in the world: spectacular fjords with a rich sea life, a great variety of bird life, and countless breathtaking hiking paths. You will explore the area during your stay in the east.</descr_partner>

			<descr_partner>In Reykjavik you can easily feel the pure energy at the heart of Iceland s capital city - whether it springs from the underground boiling thermal energy or radiates from the green scenery surrounding the city. Think of the qualities of a great city - fun, space, clean air, nature, culture - and Reykjavik has them in spades. Reykjavik offers both the features of a modern and innovative society and the marvellous traits of a unique natural landscape. The population of the Reykjavik Area is about 200,000. Reykjavik is spread across a peninsula offering a panoramic view of the mountains and the Atlantic Ocean from nearly every part of the city. In the summer, you can sit by the harbour at midnight and watch the sun dip slightly below the horizon before it makes its way up again.The world s northernmost capital is framed by the majestic Mt. Esja, which keeps a watchful eye on the city, and the blue waters of Faxafloi Bay. On a sunny day, the mystical Snaefellsjokull glacier towers over the western horizon, while mountainous moonscapes spread to the southeast.</descr_partner>
			<descr_work>Every year WF Iceland is hosting hundreds of international volunteers participating in projects all round the island. WF Iceland publishes a magazine called UNA where people can read about the life of the organization.In the beginning of the project volunteers will receive an introduction about the tasks - afterwards we will visit other WF workcamps located in Reykjavik. This is a great opportunity to step into different projects and even participate in their work a little bit. The group will take photos and make videos and interviews with volunteers, local hosts and people living in the area. The outcome will be published in the UNA WF magazine.At the end of the project we will prepare the final version of the magazine and publish it.</descr_work>
			<descr_accomodation_and_food>Worldwide Friends volunteers stay in one of several shared houses offering basic sleeping and cooking facilities in the heart of historical downtown Reykjavik. Volunteers need to bring their own sleeping bag and towels, but mattresses and bed linens are provided. Wireless internet access is provided free of charge, and volunteers also have free access to shared desktop computers in communal areas. The accommodation provided by Worldwide Friends Iceland for volunteers in Reykjavik is located within short walking distance of many urban amenities, including: banks, pharmacies, supermarkets, public swimming pools, restaurants, cafes, libraries, theaters, shops, museums, and bus stations.Food is included for the duration of the workcamp, however everyone is expected to do their fair share of the cooking and cleaning. Since it is always nice to try new and different dishes, volunteers are encouraged to bring along their favourite recipes from home</descr_accomodation_and_food>

			<descr_partner>Hverageroi is a small town of about 1,700 inhabitants that lies some 45 km east of Reykjavik. This friendly little community sits on top of a highly active geothermal field, which provides heat for hundreds of greenhouses where fruit, flowers and vegetables are produced throughout the year. Even bananas grow in these greenhouses The name Hverageroi means  hot springs garden.  Geothermal energy is Hverageroi s lifeblood, and you probably won t find such a natural wonder in the middle of a populated area anywhere else in the world. Nearby you will find an even more geothermally active site: Gufudalur, the lovely  Steam Valley  behind the town. This whole valley is full of hot springs, geysers, mud pots, fumaroles and steaming vents. Our host is the Rehabilitation and Health Clinic, which is a part of the Natural Health Association of Iceland.  Every year approximately 2,000 patients and other guests enjoy their diverse rehabilitation programs, which are focused on an approach that builds self-confidence and personal responsibility for the patients  own health. The Clinic has earned a solid reputation, both in Iceland and internationally, since its foundation in 1955 for personal and effective care of patients. It is the oldest and one of the two most important rehabilitation clinics in Iceland.</descr_partner>
			<descr_work>The Natural Health Association has a horticultural and environmental department, including forestry, gardening, and greenhouses, which is where Worldwide Friends volunteers work most of the time. The nature of the work depends largely on weather conditions, which can change quickly. Volunteers should bring clothes appropriate for outdoor work, but also clothes for working inside the warm greenhouses.</descr_work>

			<descr_partner>Reykjavik is a city full of energy, just waiting for you to experience it. Powered by heat from the earth below, with ever-changing weather sweeping across the landscape, its natural features are matched by the energy of its residents. Think of the qualities of a great city - fun, culture, nature, clean air - and Reykjavik has them in spades. All the advantages of a modern, forward-looking society are complemented by the beautiful natural setting. In a country of only just over 300,000 people, the Reykjavik Capital Area has a population of about 200,000. However, since it s the only major city in the country, Reykjavik has a lot of the amenities that you would only expect to find in a much larger center elsewhere in the world.Reykjavik is the world s northernmost capital city and is centered on the Seltjarnarnes Peninsula. Come at the right time of year, and in favorable conditions you will see the city s skyline silhouetted against the glowing, shimmering curtain of the aurora borealis, also known as the northern lights. Reykjavik is framed by the majestic Mt. Esja and the blue waters of Faxafloi Bay to the north, while rugged lava-fields spread to the southeast. On a clear sunny day, the Snaefellsjokull glacier glitters on the western horizon like a crystal.</descr_partner>
			<descr_work>The Art and Renovation camp in Reykjavik has two major activities. WF Iceland is currently renovating houses downtown Reykjavik where our volunteers are living and working. The organization is also renovating an old farm 30 km away from the capital city. Since the creation of Worldwide Friends, the organization has been looking for the opportunity to set up a project to renovate and work in old Icelandic farm.  The idea of renovating old spaces in the country side of Iceland and especially in areas where there isn t much population is one of the best ideas our organization could develop. In one hand we have the opportunity of give life to an empty and old space, on the other hand we are bringing life back to the area with the spirit and the ideas of International volunteers which will be very much welcomed by the local community. The volunteers will help us with the renovation in Reykjavik and the farm, the work depends on the skills of each volunteer. Volunteers will also participate in workshops related to visual art and/or music.</descr_work>
			<descr_accomodation_and_food>Worldwide Friends volunteers stay in one of several shared houses offering basic sleeping and cooking facilities in the heart of historical downtown Reykjavik. Volunteers need to bring their own sleeping bag and towels, but mattresses and bed linens are provided. Wireless internet access is provided free of charge, and volunteers also have free access to shared desktop computers in communal areas. The accommodation provided by Worldwide Friends Iceland for volunteers in Reykjavik is located within short walking distance of many urban amenities, including: banks, pharmacies, supermarkets, public swimming pools, restaurants, cafes, libraries, theaters, shops, museums, and bus stations.Food is included for the duration of the workcamp, however everyone is expected to do their fair share of the cooking and cleaning. Since it is always nice to try new and different dishes, volunteers are encouraged to bring along their favorite recipes from home.</descr_accomodation_and_food>

All the advantages of a modern, forward-looking society are complemented by the beautiful natural setting. In a country of only just over 300,000 people, the Reykjavik Capital Area has a population of about 200,000.

In this area you will see some of the features that make Iceland a unique place in the world: spectacular fjords with a rich sea life, a great variety of birdlife, and countless breathtaking hiking paths. You will explore the area during your stay in the east. We will be working with local people which are creating a small forestry and environmental paradise in the fjord.</descr_partner>
			<descr_work>We will  plant trees,  build hiking paths, make bridges over small rivers, move trees from one place to another, mark hiking paths and create small lakes in the area. Our work will also depend on weather conditions and that s why we have to be flexible.

			<descr_partner>Hvalfjorour (Icelandic: Whale-fjord) is situated in the west of Iceland between Mosfellsbaer and Akranes. The fjord is approximately 30 km long and 5 km wide.The name Hvalfjorour is derived from the large number of whales which could be found and caught there. Until the 1980s, one of the biggest whaling stations in Iceland was located in this fjord. In the past the fjord also contained a large number of herring fisheries.A hiking trail to the highest waterfall in Iceland, Glymur, has its origin at the innermost end of the fjord.</descr_partner>
			<descr_work>Since the creation of Worldwide friends, the organization has been looking for the opportunity to set up a project to renovate and work at an old Icelandic farm.  The idea of renovating old spaces in the country side of Iceland and especially in areas where there isn t much population is one of the best ideas our organization could develop. In one hand we have the opportunity of giving life to an empty and old space, in the other hand we are bringing life back to the area with the spirit and the ideas of International volunteers which will be very much welcomed by the local community. The first part of this Project will consist on renovating and putting the farm in good shape. There are two building that we have to renovate. The first one is the main house where volunteers will live in the near future. The second house is the storage and workshops where volunteers will keep the paint and other materials.The work on this project is a mix of renovation work and gardening.We will also take care of the property, plant trees, cleaning the area, even cleaning the coast line around the fjord There are a lot farms in the area so the volunteers will have the chance to visit other farms around and therefore to learn about Icelandic farming methods.</descr_work>
			<descr_accomodation_and_food>We will be staying in the farm. Participants are asked to bring a sleeping bag.  Food will be provided for the duration of the workcamp and everyone is expected to do his/her fair share of the cooking/cleaning. It would be nice to try new and different dishes, so please remember to bring along recipes from your own countries.</descr_accomodation_and_food>
			<descr_location_and_leisure>We will explore the whole whale fjord and the surrounding area, including a hike to the highest waterfall in Iceland.WF Iceland will also organise reasonably-priced weekend excursions to some of the most popular, beautiful areas and natural wonders that Iceland has to offer. Excursions include unique Icelandic sights such as glacial lagoons, waterfalls, volcanic and geothermal areas, glaciers, geysirs, lava forests, hot-springs, rhyolite mountain ranges, steam-vents, or even icebergs.</descr_location_and_leisure>

			<descr_partner>Raufarhofn, Thorshofn and Kopasker are there communities  located in the most northeastern part of Iceland. The geographic location of these villages makes life in winter very difficult and isolated from the rest of the Island. There are 600 people living between the 3  communities  in a square of 200 km.  WF Iceland has been running workcamps in Raufarhofn with the main goal of bringing life to the villages through international volunteering.</descr_partner>
			<descr_work>Worldwide Friends volunteers prepare games, songs and materials to present this in a kindergarten or school in order to introduce the kids to different cultures. Volunteers are asked to bring cultural materials like information,pictures etc. from their home countries that can be used in these presentations. The workcamp is divided in two parts: During the first week the volunteers get to know each other by group dynamics. As well volunteers will brainstorm about the different ideas and games proposed for the camp. They will prepare the games and all necessary materials needed for the presentations. We will also use recycling materials. During the second week volunteers will visit then kindergartens or schools in three communities in the northeast of Iceland . The visits will be approximately three or four per project. A session at the kindergartens takes approximately one hourThe  workcamp will also concentrate on intercultural learning and exchange. Every evening a different country will cook for the rest of the Group and will be in charge of presenting their origin country and culture in a non formal way. It could be a presentation, games, theater or however you would like to show it. Therefore we recommend bringing food, photos or whatever you think is important and nice for the Worldwide evenings.</descr_work>

			<descr_partner>Hverageroi is a small town of about 1,700 inhabitants that lies some 45 km east of Reykjavik. This friendly little community sits on top of a highly active geothermal field, which provides heat for hundreds of greenhouses where fruit, flowers and vegetables are produced throughout the year. Even bananas grow in these greenhouses The name Hverageroi means  hot springs garden.  Geothermal energy is Hverageroi s lifeblood, and you probably won t find such a natural wonder in the middle of a populated area anywhere else in the world. Nearby you will find an even more geothermally active site: Gufudalur, the lovely  Steam Valley  behind the town. This whole valley is full of hot springs, geysers, mud pots, fumaroles and steaming vents. Our host is the Rehabilitation and Health Clinic, which is a part of the Natural Health Association of Iceland. Every year approximately 2,000 patients and other guests enjoy their diverse rehabilitation programs, which are focused on an approach that builds self-confidence and personal responsibility for the patients  own health. The Clinic has earned a solid reputation, both in Iceland and internationally, since its foundation in 1955 for personal and effective care of patients. It is the oldest and one of the two most important rehabilitation clinics in Iceland.</descr_partner>
			<descr_work>The Natural Health Association has a horticultural and environmental department, including forestry, gardening, and greenhouses, which is where Worldwide Friends volunteers work most of the time. The nature of the work depends largely on weather conditions, which can change quickly. Volunteers should bring clothes appropriate for outdoor work, but also clothes for working inside the warm greenhouses.</descr_work>
			<descr_accomodation_and_food>Worldwide Friends volunteers stay in a fully equipped bungalow consisting of several double rooms. Volunteers need to bring their own sleeping bag, but mattresses are provided. Free wireless internet is available during evening hours, but volunteers need to bring their own laptops if they would like to connect to it. All meals are provided and cooked by our hosts, the Rehabilitation and Health Clinic. The menu for the project is primarily vegetarian, but two times a week it includes locally-caught fish. The food at the Rehabilitation and Health Clinic is known throughout Iceland for its high quality.</descr_accomodation_and_food>

			<descr_partner>Reykjavik is a city full of energy, just waiting for you to experience it. Powered by heat from the earth below, with ever-changing weather sweeping across the landscape, its natural features are matched by the energy of its residents. Think of the qualities of a great city - fun, culture, nature, clean air - and Reykjavik has them in spades. All the advantages of a modern, forward-looking society are complemented by the beautiful natural setting. In a country of only just over 300,000 people, the Reykjavik Capital Area has a population of about 200,000. However, since it s the only major city in the country, Reykjavik has a lot of the amenities that you would only expect to find in a much larger center elsewhere in the world.Reykjavik is the world s northernmost capital city and is centered on the Seltjarnarnes Peninsula. Come at the right time of year, and in favorable conditions you will see the city s skyline silhouetted against the glowing, shimmering curtain of the aurora borealis, also known as the northern lights. Reykjavik is framed by the majestic Mt. Esja and the blue waters of Faxafloi Bay to the north, while rugged lava-fields spread to the southeast. On a clear sunny day, the Snaefellsjokull glacier glitters on the western horizon like a crystal.</descr_partner>
			<descr_work>This workcamp all is about awareness. The volunteers will be the leaders of environmental education sessions in high schools in Reykjavik. The main goal is to create awareness among children and teenagers and promote protecting the environment in daily life. The work will be divided between preparation of materials such as posters, brochure, info mobile centre with photos and explanations, power points, and videos. During the second week the volunteers will visit high schools to perform the session. During the camp the volunteers will enjoy a percussion workshop in order to give a small performance in the high school and catch the attention of the students.</descr_work>

			<descr_partner>Neskaupstaour is a medium size town by Icelandic standards. With its 1.420 inhabitants, it has the largest population in the East Fjords. The town has been growing and prospering since the early 1900s and is almost completely self sufficient thanks to the fishing industry. Sitting in the middle of nowhere, away from other villages and communities, the town is equipped with all the necessary facilities and stores: a bakery, a local dairy, supermarkets, banks, a post office, a school, a sports hall, a swimming pool, a church, a hospital, a harbor, a airstrip, a hotel, a jazz club, a rescue centre, etc. As a matter of fact, it has all the services and professionals you would expect in a larger town, with the exception of an optician On the east side of town the wildlife reserve and a large recreational area facing the ocean. In the lower section of the reserve, called Hagi, lies the famous Paskahellir (Easter Cave), a rock vault over the shore. Holes left by thick, 10 to 12-million-year-old tree trunks can be seen inside the vault and, in true Icelandic spirit, various folk tales are associated with the cave. Neskaupstaour can be reached only driving through a one-way tunnel over the highest year round pass in Iceland. Eistnaflug is a Heavy Rock Festival which this year will present its 5th edition. More than 40 bands will perform for an expected audience of about one thousand visitors.  It will take place July 9-12.  For additional information, visit: www.eistnaflug.is.</descr_partner>
			<descr_work>We will help the organizers of the festival to carry out different tasks. For example, we will take care of the venues before and after the concerts, control the access to the festival area and prepare the camping site. We will assist the local organization in keeping the area clean during the festival. We will also do some environmental work in cooperation with the local community before and after the festival.</descr_work>
			<descr_accomodation_and_food>We will be staying in a house owned by the local community in Neskaupstaour / Eskifjordur offering basic facilities. Mattresses will be provided and everyone is asked to bring his/her own warm sleeping bag. We will take showers at the local swimming pool and sports centre near by the house. It is possible that we will also stay in tents for one or two nights during the festival just to get the right spirit. The food will be supplied for the duration of the work camp and everyone is expected to do his/her fair part of the cooking/cleaning. It would be nice to try new and different dishes, so please remember to bring along recipes from your own countries.</descr_accomodation_and_food>

			<descr_partner>In Reykjavik you can easily feel the pure energy at the heart of Iceland s capital city - whether it springs from the underground boiling thermal energy or radiates from the green scenery surrounding the city. Think of the qualities of a great city - fun, space, clean air, nature, culture - and Reykjavik has them in spades. Reykjavik offers both the features of a modern and innovative society and the marvellous traits of a unique natural landscape. The population of the Reykjavik Area is about 200,000. Reykjavik is spread across a peninsula offering a panoramic view of the mountains and the Atlantic Ocean from nearly every part of the city. In the summer, you can sit by the harbour at midnight and watch the sun dip slightly below the horizon before it makes its way up again.The world s northernmost capital is framed by the majestic Mt. Esja, which keeps a watchful eye on the city, and the blue waters of Faxafloi Bay. On a sunny day, the mystical Snaefellsjokull glacier towers over the western horizon, while mountainous moonscapes spread to the southeast.</descr_partner>
			<descr_work>The purpose of this camp is to involve young international volunteers in a group experience where they can improve their communication and visual arts skills by capturing some memories in an unforgettable way using photographs and videos. Volunteers will put into action ideas about photography from capture to finished image.  In this camp, volunteers learn together from each other how to better express their vision and how to digitally edit images to highlight the same qualities that drew them to the scene to begin with. Volunteers will work on different themes, such as landscape, fishermen s life, light and colour, local lifestyle etc. In the evenings the volunteers will gather together to share photos and the camp will culminate in a photo exhibition.This work camp is a way to enjoy an amazing time in Iceland with other international volunteers and to have an incredible experience where participants share their knowledge on photography with each other while they are exploring creativity, environmental issues and intercultural learning. So don t worry if you re not an experienced photographer, because the workcamp doesn t require advanced knowledge and it isn t a competition. Please note that volunteers need to bring their own cameras to the workcamp. The volunteers should also keep in mind that the leaders are not professional photographers.</descr_work>

			<descr_partner>The village of Raufarhofn is the community that lies farthest north in Iceland. It is located in the eastern part of Melrakkasletta close to the Arctic Circle. The population of Raufarhofn is about 200 and most of the people there earn their living from fishing and fish processing. The harbor is very beautiful and partly shaped by nature itself. A wide and untouched open area surrounds the village with a lot of birds and varied vegetation. In summer one will observe wild migratory birds within the village being a part of the village life with the villagers most often waking up in the morning to the songs of birds. The coastline with its inlets and creeks is filled with driftwood and reaches out into the Arctic Sea. Away and on the surface of the sea various sea-birds will be spotted and an occasional seal. On the beach waders strut and inland on the grassy moorlands there are dozens of lakes filled with trout. In the vicinity many species of ducks, waders and species that favor heaths and moorlands may be observed.</descr_partner>
			<descr_work>the purpose of this camp is very diverse. During these camp volunteers will be able to cooperate in different tasks. Depending to the season or month where volunteers will participate in the camp the themes will be different. WF owns a center in the village. During the first month of the summer the camp will be more focused on cultural activities for the people and the youth of the village. Activities such as cultural coffees , international evenings, workshop which volunteers can develop, renovation work such us painting and cleaning the House and visual arts project such a sharing photography knowledge s, video filming and editing. During the last 2 months of the summer volunteers will work more on environmental tasks such as cleaning the coast line. During this time the local Youth goes back to school and is more difficult to gather people for cultural evening. Another reason to avoid environmental work during the first 2 months is due to the migrant birds known as CRIA in Iceland. About this time they are nesting and is not good to disturb the areas. At the end of August the fly back again and is perfect time for coastline cleaning. Also during this time volunteers will have the chance to share photo skills and video and edit and produce visual arts materials to be use afterwards on our website.This work camp is a way to enjoy an amazing time in Iceland with other international volunteers and to have an incredible experience where participants share their knowledge with each other while they are exploring creativity, environmental issues and intercultural learning.</descr_work>

			<descr_partner>Scoured by Ice Age glaciers, the dramatic east coast boasts long, narrow fjords with steep sides and jagged peaks which contrast with inland fertile farmlands. Natural harbors mean picture-postcard fishing villages and seemingly never-ending roads cross the region, providing beautiful sweeping views.  Fjaroabyggo  is an association of villages in the Eastern fjords of Iceland. It includes the towns of Eskifjorour, Faskruosfjorour, Mjoifjorour, Neskaupstaour, Reyoarfjorour and Stoovarfjorour, all tiny fishing villages with steep mountains towering just behind the houses. In this area you will see some of the features that make Iceland a unique place in the world: spectacular fjords with a rich sea life, a great variety of bird life, and countless breathtaking hiking paths. You will explore the area during your stay in the east.</descr_partner>
			<descr_work>Most of the work will consist of cleaning and beautifying the towns and the surrounding area. We will also do some other environmental tasks for example clean the coastline, plant trees or build hiking paths. Our work will also depend on weather conditions and that s why we have to be flexible. Please keep in mind that the work might be physically hard and you should be prepared for unfriendly weather, even though, hope- fully, it will be nice most of the time. This is a perfect camp for people who like outdoor work and physical challenges</descr_work>

			<descr_partner>Scoured by Ice Age glaciers, the dramatic east coast boasts long, narrow fjords with steep sides and jagged peaks which contrast with inland fertile farmlands. Natural harbours mean picture-postcard fishing villages and seemingly never-ending roads cross the region, providing beautiful sweeping views.  Fjaroabyggo  is an association of villages in the Eastern fjords of Iceland. It includes the towns of Eskifjorour, Faskruosfjorour, Mjoifjorour, Neskaupstaour, Reyoarfjorour and Stoovarfjorour, all tiny fishing villages with steep mountains towering just behind the houses. In this area you will see some of the features that make Iceland a unique place in the world: spectacular fjords with a rich sea life, a great variety of birdlife, and countless breathtaking hiking paths. You will explore the area during your stay in the east.</descr_partner>

			<descr_partner>Hverageroi is a small town of about 1,700 inhabitants that lies some 45 km east of Reykjavik. This friendly little community sits on top of a highly active geothermal field, which provides heat for hundreds of greenhouses where fruit, flowers and vegetables are produced throughout the year. Even bananas grow in these greenhouses The name Hverageroi means  hot springs garden.  Geothermal energy is Hverageroi s lifeblood, and you probably won t find such a natural wonder in the middle of a populated area anywhere else in the world. Nearby you will find an even more geothermally active site: Gufudalur, the lovely  Steam Valley  behind the town. This whole valley is full of hot springs, geysers, mud pots, fumaroles and steaming vents. Our host is the Rehabilitation and Health Clinic, which is a part of the Natural Health Association of Iceland. Every year approximately 2,000 patients and other guests enjoy their diverse rehabilitation programs, which are focused on an approach that builds self-confidence and personal responsibility for the patients  own health. The Clinic has earned a solid reputation, both in Iceland and internationally, since its foundation in 1955 for personal and effective care of patients. It is the oldest and one of the two most important rehabilitation clinics in Iceland.</descr_partner>
			<descr_work>The Natural Health Association has a horticultural and environmental department, including forestry, gardening, and greenhouses, which is where Worldwide Friends volunteers work most of the time. The nature of the work depends largely on weather conditions, which can change quickly. Volunteers should bring clothes appropriate for outdoor work, but also clothes for working inside the warm greenhouses.</descr_work>
			<descr_accomodation_and_food>Worldwide Friends volunteers stay in a fully equipped bungalow consisting of several double rooms. Volunteers need to bring their own sleeping bag, but mattresses are provided. Free wireless internet is available during evening hours, but volunteers need to bring their own laptops if they would like to connect to it. All meals are provided and cooked by our hosts, the Rehabilitation and Health Clinic. The menu for the project is primarily vegetarian, but two times a week it includes locally-caught fish. The food at the Rehabilitation and Health Clinic is known throughout Iceland for its high quality.</descr_accomodation_and_food>
			<descr_location_and_leisure>Worldwide Friends volunteers have free access to the local geothermally-heated swimming pools. Traditionally, natural pools have played an important social role in Icelandic culture. Most Icelandic pools offer indoor and outdoor swimming, as well as hot tubs and saunas or steam rooms. Hverageroi is known for having great areas for hiking, including a river heated by hot springs. WF Iceland will also organise reasonably-priced weekend excursions to some of the most popular, beautiful areas and natural wonders that Iceland has to offer. Excursions include unique Icelandic sights such as glacial lagoons, waterfalls, volcanic and geothermal areas, glaciers, geysirs, lava forests, hot-springs, rhyolite mountain ranges, steam-vents, or even icebergs.</descr_location_and_leisure>

			<descr_partner>Reykjavik is a city full of energy, just waiting for you to experience it. Powered by heat from the earth below, with ever-changing weather sweeping across the landscape, its natural features are matched by the energy of its residents. Think of the qualities of a great city - fun, culture, nature, clean air - and Reykjavik has them in spades. All the advantages of a modern, forward-looking society are complemented by the beautiful natural setting. In a country of only just over 300,000 people, the Reykjavik Capital Area has a population of about 200,000. However, since it s the only major city in the country, Reykjavik has a lot of the amenities that you would only expect to find in a much larger center elsewhere in the world.Reykjavik is the world s northernmost capital city and is centered on the Seltjarnarnes Peninsula. Come at the right time of year, and in favorable conditions you will see the city s skyline silhouetted against the glowing, shimmering curtain of the aurora borealis, also known as the northern lights. Reykjavik is framed by the majestic Mt. Esja and the blue waters of Faxafloi Bay to the north, while rugged lava-fields spread to the southeast. On a clear sunny day, the Snaefellsjokull glacier glitters on the western horizon like a crystal.</descr_partner>
			<descr_work>The Art and Renovation camp in Reykjavik has two major activities. WF Iceland is currently renovating houses downtown Reykjavik where our volunteers are living and working. The organization is also renovating an old farm 30 km away from the capital city. Since the creation of Worldwide Friends, the organization has been looking for the opportunity to set up a project to renovate and work in old Icelandic farm.  The idea of renovating old spaces in the country side of Iceland and especially in areas where there isn t much population is one of the best ideas our organization could develop. In one hand we have the opportunity of give life to an empty and old space, on the other hand we are bringing life back to the area with the spirit and the ideas of International volunteers which will be very much welcomed by the local community. The volunteers will help us with the renovation in Reykjavik and the farm, the work depends on the skills of each volunteer. Volunteers will also participate in workshops related to visual art and/or music.</descr_work>
			<descr_accomodation_and_food>Worldwide Friends volunteers stay in one of several shared houses offering basic sleeping and cooking facilities in the heart of historical downtown Reykjavik. Volunteers need to bring their own sleeping bag and towels, but mattresses and bed linens are provided. Wireless internet access is provided free of charge, and volunteers also have free access to shared desktop computers in communal areas. The accommodation provided by Worldwide Friends Iceland for volunteers in Reykjavik is located within short walking distance of many urban amenities, including: banks, pharmacies, supermarkets, public swimming pools, restaurants, cafes, libraries, theaters, shops, museums, and bus stations.Food is included for the duration of the workcamp, however everyone is expected to do their fair share of the cooking and cleaning. Since it is always nice to try new and different dishes, volunteers are encouraged to bring along their favorite recipes from home.</descr_accomodation_and_food>

			<descr_partner>Hvalfjorour (Icelandic: Whale-fjord) is situated in the west of Iceland between Mosfellsbaer and Akranes. The fjord is approximately 30 km long and 5 km wide.The name Hvalfjorour is derived from the large number of whales which could be found and caught there. Until the 1980s, one of the biggest whaling stations in Iceland was located in this fjord. In the past the fjord also contained a large number of herring fisheries.A hiking trail to the highest waterfall in Iceland, Glymur, has its origin at the innermost end of the fjord.</descr_partner>
			<descr_work>Since the creation of Worldwide friends, the organization has been looking for the opportunity to set up a project to renovate and work at an old Icelandic farm.  The idea of renovating old spaces in the country side of Iceland and especially in areas where there isn t much population is one of the best ideas our organization could develop. In one hand we have the opportunity of giving life to an empty and old space, in the other hand we are bringing life back to the area with the spirit and the ideas of International volunteers which will be very much welcomed by the local community. The first part of this Project will consist on renovating and putting the farm in good shape. There are two building that we have to renovate. The first one is the main house where volunteers will live in the near future. The second house is the storage and workshops where volunteers will keep the paint and other materials.The work on this project is a mix of renovation work and gardening.We will also take care of the property, plant trees, cleaning the area, even cleaning the coast line around the fjord There are a lot farms in the area so the volunteers will have the chance to visit other farms around and therefore to learn about Icelandic farming methods.</descr_work>
			<descr_accomodation_and_food>We will be staying in the farm. Participants are asked to bring a sleeping bag.  Food will be provided for the duration of the workcamp and everyone is expected to do his/her fair share of the cooking/cleaning. It would be nice to try new and different dishes, so please remember to bring along recipes from your own countries.</descr_accomodation_and_food>

Think of the qualities of a great city - fun, culture, nature, clean air - and Reykjavik has them in spades. All the advantages of a modern, forward-looking society are complemented by the beautiful natural setting. In a country of only just over 300,000 people, the Reykjavik Capital Area has a population of about 200,000. However, since it s the only major city in the country, Reykjavik has a lot of the amenities that you would only expect to find in a much larger center elsewhere in the world.Reykjavik is the world s northernmost capital city and is centred on the Seltjarnarnes Peninsula. Come at the right time of year, and in favourable conditions you will see the city s skyline silhouetted against the glowing, shimmering curtain of the aurora borealis, also known as the northern lights. Reykjavik is framed by the majestic Mt. Esja and the blue waters of Faxafloi Bay to the north, while rugged lava-fields spread to the southeast. On a clear sunny day, the Snaefellsjokull glacier glitters on the western horizon like a crystal.</descr_partner>
			<descr_work>The Art and Renovation camp in Reykjavik has two major activities. WF Iceland is currently renovating houses downtown Reykjavik where our volunteers are living and working. The organization is also renovating an old farm 30 km away from the capital city. Since the creation of Worldwide Friends, the organization has been looking for the opportunity to set up a project to renovate and work in old Icelandic farm.  The idea of renovating old spaces in the country side of Iceland and especially in areas where there isn t much population is one of the best ideas our organization could develop. In one hand we have the opportunity of give life to an empty and old space, on the other hand we are bringing life back to the area with the spirit and the ideas of International volunteers which will be very much welcomed by the local community. The volunteers will help us with the renovation in Reykjavik and the farm, the work depends on the skills of each volunteer. Volunteers will also participate in workshops related to visual art and/or music.</descr_work>
			<descr_accomodation_and_food>Worldwide Friends volunteers stay in one of several shared houses offering basic sleeping and cooking facilities in the heart of historical downtown Reykjavik. Volunteers need to bring their own sleeping bag and towels, but mattresses and bed linens are provided. Wireless internet access is provided free of charge, and volunteers also have free access to shared desktop computers in communal areas. The accommodation provided by Worldwide Friends Iceland for volunteers in Reykjavik is located within short walking distance of many urban amenities, including: banks, pharmacies, supermarkets, public swimming pools, restaurants, cafes, libraries, theatres, shops, museums, and bus stations.Food is included for the duration of the workcamp, however everyone is expected to do their fair share of the cooking and cleaning. Since it is always nice to try new and different dishes, volunteers are encouraged to bring along their favorite recipes from home</descr_accomodation_and_food>
			<descr_location_and_leisure>Worldwide Friends volunteers have free access to the local geothermal-heated swimming pools in Reykjavik. Traditionally, natural pools have played an important social role in Icelandic culture. Most Icelandic pools offer indoor and outdoor swimming, as well as hot tubs and saunas or steam rooms.On weekends, the central location of the accommodations is ideal for enjoying Reykjavik s amazing nightlife, which is world-renowned for its wide array of bars, clubs, and concerts.WF Iceland will also organise reasonably-priced weekend excursions to some of the most popular, beautiful areas and natural wonders that Iceland has to offer. Excursions include unique Icelandic sights such as glacial lagoons, waterfalls, volcanic and geothermal areas, glaciers, geysirs, lava forests, hot-springs, rhyolite mountain ranges, steam-vents, or even icebergs.</descr_location_and_leisure>

			<descr_partner>Hverageroi is a small town of about 1,700 inhabitants that lies some 45 km east of Reykjavik. This friendly little community sits on top of a highly active geothermal field, which provides heat for hundreds of greenhouses where fruit, flowers and vegetables are produced throughout the year. Even bananas grow in these greenhouses The name Hverageroi means  hot springs garden.  Geothermal energy is Hverageroi s lifeblood, and you probably won t find such a natural wonder in the middle of a populated area anywhere else in the world. Nearby you will find an even more geothermally active site: Gufudalur, the lovely  Steam Valley  behind the town. This whole valley is full of hot springs, geysers, mud pots, fumaroles and steaming vents. Our host is the Rehabilitation and Health Clinic, which is a part of the Natural Health Association of Iceland. Every year approximately 2,000 patients and other guests enjoy their diverse rehabilitation programs, which are focused on an approach that builds self-confidence and personal responsibility for the patients  own health. The Clinic has earned a solid reputation, both in Iceland and internationally, since its foundation in 1955 for personal and effective care of patients. It is the oldest and one of the two most important rehabilitation clinics in Iceland.</descr_partner>
			<descr_work>The Natural Health Association has a horticultural and environmental department, including forestry, gardening, and greenhouses, which is where Worldwide Friends volunteers work most of the time. The nature of the work depends largely on weather conditions, which can change quickly. Volunteers should bring clothes appropriate for outdoor work, but also clothes for working inside the warm greenhouses.</descr_work>
			<descr_accomodation_and_food>Worldwide Friends volunteers stay in a fully equipped bungalow consisting of several double rooms. Volunteers need to bring their own sleeping bag, but mattresses are provided. Free wireless internet is available during evening hours, but volunteers need to bring their own laptops if they would like to connect to it. All meals are provided and cooked by our hosts, the Rehabilitation and Health Clinic. The menu for the project is primarily vegetarian, but two times a week it includes locally-caught fish. The food at the Rehabilitation and Health Clinic is known throughout Iceland for its high quality.</descr_accomodation_and_food>

			<descr_partner>The village of Raufarhofn is the community that lies farthest north in Iceland. It is located in the eastern part of Melrakkasletta close to the Arctic Circle. The population of Raufarhofn is about 200 and most of the people there earn their living from fishing and fish processing. The harbor is very beautiful and partly shaped by nature itself. A wide and untouched open area surrounds the village with a lot of birds and varied vegetation. In summer one will observe wild migratory birds within the village being a part of the village life with the villagers most often waking up in the morning to the songs of birds. The coastline with its inlets and creeks is filled with driftwood and reaches out into the Arctic Sea. Away and on the surface of the sea various sea-birds will be spotted and an occasional seal. On the beach waders strut and inland on the grassy moorlands there are dozens of lakes filled with trout. In the vicinity many species of ducks, waders and species that favor heaths and moorlands may be observed.</descr_partner>
			<descr_work>the purpose of this camp is very diverse. During these camp volunteers will be able to cooperate in different tasks. Depending to the season or month where volunteers will participate in the camp the themes will be different. WF owns a center in the village. During the first month of the summer the camp will be more focused on cultural activities for the people and the youth of the village. Activities such as cultural coffees , international evenings, workshop which volunteers can develop, renovation work such us painting and cleaning the House and visual arts project such a sharing photography knowledge s, video filming and editing. During the last 2 months of the summer volunteers will work more on environmental tasks such as cleaning the coast line. During this time the local Youth goes back to school and is more difficult to gather people for cultural evening. Another reason to avoid environmental work during the first 2 months is due to the migrant birds known as CRIA in Iceland. About this time they are nesting and is not good to disturb the areas. At the end of August the fly back again and is perfect time for coastline cleaning. Also during this time volunteers will have the chance to share photo skills and video and edit and produce visual arts materials to be use afterwards on our website.This work camp is a way to enjoy an amazing time in Iceland with other international volunteers and to have an incredible experience where participants share their knowledge with each other while they are exploring creativity, environmental issues and intercultural learning.</descr_work>

			<descr_partner>Scoured by Ice Age glaciers, the dramatic east coast boasts long, narrow fjords with steep sides and jagged peaks which contrast with inland fertile farmlands. Natural harbours mean picture-postcard fishing villages and seemingly never-ending roads cross the region, providing beautiful sweeping views.  Fjaroabyggo  is an association of villages in the Eastern fjords of Iceland. It includes the towns of Eskifjorour, Faskruosfjorour, Mjoifjorour, Neskaupstaour, Reyoarfjorour and Stoovarfjorour, all tiny fishing villages with steep mountains towering just behind the houses. In this area you will see some of the features that make Iceland a unique place in the world: spectacular fjords with a rich sea life, a great variety of birdlife, and countless breathtaking hiking paths. You will explore the area during your stay in the east.</descr_partner>

During the 12 days program participants will have the chance to get to know Icelandic nature, history and people. The Team leaders of these camps will be trained on how lead kids of this age and oriented them into how to be a part of the daily community life in a camp. The young volunteers will follow a program which is a mixture of environmental voluntary work and games. We will also go for hikes to discover the fantastic landscapes in the East of Iceland. The volunteers will also help with renovation and environmental work in the area .

			<descr_partner>In Reykjavik you can easily feel the pure energy at the heart of Iceland s capital city - whether it springs from the underground boiling thermal energy or radiates from the green scenery surrounding the city. Think of the qualities of a great city - fun, space, clean air, nature, culture - and Reykjavik has them in spades. Reykjavik offers both the features of a modern and innovative society and the marvellous traits of a unique natural landscape. The population of the Reykjavik Area is about 200,000. Reykjavik is spread across a peninsula offering a panoramic view of the mountains and the Atlantic Ocean from nearly every part of the city. In the summer, you can sit by the harbour at midnight and watch the sun dip slightly below the horizon before it makes its way up again.The world s northernmost capital is framed by the majestic Mt. Esja, which keeps a watchful eye on the city, and the blue waters of Faxafloi Bay. On a sunny day, the mystical Snaefellsjokull glacier towers over the western horizon, while mountainous moonscapes spread to the southeast.</descr_partner>
			<descr_work>The purpose of this camp is to involve young international volunteers in a group experience where they can improve their communication and visual arts skills by capturing some memories in an unforgettable way using photographs and videos. Volunteers will put into action ideas about photography from capture to finished image.  In this camp, volunteers learn together from each other how to better express their vision and how to digitally edit images to highlight the same qualities that drew them to the scene to begin with. Volunteers will work on different themes, such as landscape, fishermen s life, light and colour, local lifestyle etc. In the evenings the volunteers will gather together to share photos and the camp will culminate in a photo exhibition.This work camp is a way to enjoy an amazing time in Iceland with other international volunteers and to have an incredible experience where participants share their knowledge on photography with each other while they are exploring creativity, environmental issues and intercultural learning. So don t worry if you re not an experienced photographer, because the workcamp doesn t require advanced knowledge and it isn t a competition. Please note that volunteers need to bring their own cameras to the workcamp. The volunteers should also keep in mind that the leaders are not professional photographers.</descr_work>
			<descr_accomodation_and_food>Worldwide Friends volunteers stay in one of several shared houses offering basic sleeping and cooking facilities in the heart of historical downtown Reykjavik.

			<descr_partner>:  Hvalfjorour (Icelandic: Whale-fjord) is situated in the west of Iceland between Mosfellsbaer and Akranes. The fjord is approximately 30 km long and 5 km wide.The name Hvalfjorour is derived from the large number of whales which could be found and caught there. Until the 1980s, one of the biggest whaling stations in Iceland was located in this fjord. In the past the fjord also contained a large number of herring fisheries.A hiking trail to the highest waterfall in Iceland, Glymur, has its origin at the innermost end of the fjord.</descr_partner>
			<descr_work>Since the creation of Worldwide friends, the organization has been looking for the opportunity to set up a project to renovate and work at an old Icelandic farm.  The idea of renovating old spaces in the country side of Iceland and especially in areas where there isn t much population is one of the best ideas our organization could develop. In one hand we have the opportunity of giving life to an empty and old space, in the other hand we are bringing life back to the area with the spirit and the ideas of International volunteers which will be very much welcomed by the local community. The first part of this Project will consist on renovating and putting the farm in good shape. There are two building that we have to renovate. The first one is the main house where volunteers will live in the near future. The second house is the storage and workshops where volunteers will keep the paint and other materials.The work on this project is a mix of renovation work and gardening.We will also take care of the property, plant trees, cleaning the area, even cleaning the coast line around the fjord There are a lot farms in the area so the volunteers will have the chance to visit other farms around and therefore to learn about Icelandic farming methods.</descr_work>
			<descr_accomodation_and_food>We will be staying in the farm. Participants are asked to bring a sleeping bag.  Food will be provided for the duration of the workcamp and everyone is expected to do his/her fair share of the cooking/cleaning. It would be nice to try new and different dishes, so please remember to bring along recipes from your own countries.</descr_accomodation_and_food>
			<descr_location_and_leisure>We will explore the whole whale fjord and the surrounding area, including a hike to the highest waterfall in Iceland.WF Iceland will also organise reasonably-priced weekend excursions to some of the most popular, beautiful areas and natural wonders that Iceland has to offer.

			<descr_partner>Reykjavik is a city full of energy, just waiting for you to experience it. Powered by heat from the earth below, with ever-changing weather sweeping across the landscape, its natural features are matched by the energy of its residents. Think of the qualities of a great city - fun, culture, nature, clean air - and Reykjavik has them in spades. All the advantages of a modern, forward-looking society are complemented by the beautiful natural setting. In a country of only just over 300,000 people, the Reykjavik Capital Area has a population of about 200,000. However, since it s the only major city in the country, Reykjavik has a lot of the amenities that you would only expect to find in a much larger center elsewhere in the world.Reykjavik is the world s northernmost capital city and is centered on the Seltjarnarnes Peninsula. Come at the right time of year, and in favorable conditions you will see the city s skyline silhouetted against the glowing, shimmering curtain of the aurora borealis, also known as the northern lights. Reykjavik is framed by the majestic Mt. Esja and the blue waters of Faxafloi Bay to the north, while rugged lava-fields spread to the southeast. On a clear sunny day, the Snaefellsjokull glacier glitters on the western horizon like a crystal.</descr_partner>
			<descr_work>The Art and Renovation camp in Reykjavik has two major activities. WF Iceland is currently renovating houses downtown Reykjavik where our volunteers are living and working. The organization is also renovating an old farm 30 km away from the capital city.

			<descr_partner>Hverageroi is a small town of about 1,700 inhabitants that lies some 45 km east of Reykjavik. This friendly little community sits on top of a highly active geothermal field, which provides heat for hundreds of greenhouses where fruit, flowers and vegetables are produced throughout the year. Even bananas grow in these greenhouses The name Hverageroi means  hot springs garden.  Geothermal energy is Hverageroi s lifeblood, and you probably won t find such a natural wonder in the middle of a populated area anywhere else in the world. Nearby you will find an even more geothermally active site: Gufudalur, the lovely  Steam Valley  behind the town. This whole valley is full of hot springs, geysers, mud pots, fumaroles and steaming vents. Our host is the Rehabilitation and Health Clinic, which is a part of the Natural Health Association of Iceland.  Every year approximately 2,000 patients and other guests enjoy their diverse rehabilitation programs, which are focused on an approach that builds self-confidence and personal responsibility for the patients  own health. The Clinic has earned a solid reputation, both in Iceland and internationally, since its foundation in 1955 for personal and effective care of patients. It is the oldest and one of the two most important rehabilitation clinics in Iceland.</descr_partner>
			<descr_work>The Natural Health Association has a horticultural and environmental department, including forestry, gardening, and greenhouses, which is where Worldwide Friends volunteers work most of the time.

			<descr_partner>Reykjavik is a city full of energy, just waiting for you to experience it. Powered by heat from the earth below, with ever-changing weather sweeping across the landscape, its natural features are matched by the energy of its residents.  Think of the qualities of a great city - fun, culture, nature, clean air - and Reykjavik has them in spades. All the advantages of a modern, forward-looking society are complemented by the beautiful natural setting. In a country of only just over 300,000 people, the Reykjavik Capital Area has a population of about 200,000. However, since it s the only major city in the country, Reykjavik has a lot of the amenities that you would only expect to find in a much larger center elsewhere in the world.Reykjavik is the world s northernmost capital city and is centred on the Seltjarnarnes Peninsula. Come at the right time of year, and in favourable conditions you will see the city s skyline silhouetted against the glowing, shimmering curtain of the aurora borealis, also known as the northern lights. Reykjavik is framed by the majestic Mt. Esja and the blue waters of Faxafloi Bay to the north, while rugged lava-fields spread to the southeast. On a clear sunny day, the Snaefellsjokull glacier glitters on the western horizon like a crystal.</descr_partner>
			<descr_work>We will help the organizers of the Reykjavik International Film Festival with different tasks before and during the festival. Our group of international volunteers will work closely with the team of Icelandic volunteers which are in most cases students of the Universities in Reykjavik. We will put up posters and hand out leaflets and brochures around the city before the festival starts; some of the volunteers might be asked to pick up international guests at the airport. During the festival we will sell entrance tickets and festival passes, setup the venues before and after the movies and control the entrance if needed.  There might be other tasks to be done and we will have to be flexible and willing to give a helping hand whenever necessary. The festival is one of the most important cultural events in Reykjavik and the work of the volunteers is a crucial contribution to the event. It is interesting for the volunteers to be part of this international project and have the opportunity to experience its amazing atmosphere.</descr_work>
			<descr_accomodation_and_food>Worldwide Friends volunteers stay in one of several shared houses offering basic sleeping and cooking facilities in the heart of historical downtown Reykjavik. Volunteers need to bring their own sleeping bag and towels, but mattresses and bed linens are provided. Wireless internet access is provided free of charge, and volunteers also have free access to shared desktop computers in communal areas. The accommodation provided by Worldwide Friends Iceland for volunteers in Reykjavik is located within short walking distance of many urban amenities, including: banks, pharmacies, supermarkets, public swimming pools, restaurants, cafes, libraries, theatres, shops, museums, and bus stations.Food is included for the duration of the workcamp, however everyone is expected to do their fair share of the cooking and cleaning. Since it is always nice to try new and different dishes, volunteers are encouraged to bring along their favourite recipes from home</descr_accomodation_and_food>
			<descr_location_and_leisure>Worldwide Friends volunteers have free access to the local geothermally-heated swimming pools in Reykjavik. Traditionally, natural pools have played an important social role in Icelandic culture. Most Icelandic pools offer indoor and outdoor swimming, as well as hot tubs and saunas or steam rooms.On weekends, the central location of the accommodations is ideal for enjoying Reykjavik s amazing nightlife, which is world-renowned for its wide array of bars, clubs, and concerts. WF Iceland will also organise reasonably-priced weekend excursions to some of the most popular, beautiful areas and natural wonders that Iceland has to offer. Excursions include unique Icelandic sights such as glacial lagoons, waterfalls, volcanic and geothermal areas, glaciers, geysers, lava forests, hot-springs, rhyolite mountain ranges, steam-vents,  or even icebergs.</descr_location_and_leisure>

			<descr_partner>The village of Raufarhofn is the community that lies farthest north in Iceland. It is located in the eastern part of Melrakkasletta close to the Arctic Circle. The population of Raufarhofn is about 200 and most of the people there earn their living from fishing and fish processing. The harbor is very beautiful and partly shaped by nature itself. A wide and untouched open area surrounds the village with a lot of birds and varied vegetation. In summer one will observe wild migratory birds within the village being a part of the village life with the villagers most often waking up in the morning to the songs of birds. The coastline with its inlets and creeks is filled with driftwood and reaches out into the Arctic Sea. Away and on the surface of the sea various sea-birds will be spotted and an occasional seal. On the beach waders strut and inland on the grassy moorlands there are dozens of lakes filled with trout. In the vicinity many species of ducks, waders and species that favor heaths and moorlands may be observed.</descr_partner>
			<descr_work>the purpose of this camp is very diverse. During these camp volunteers will be able to cooperate in different tasks. Depending to the season or month where volunteers will participate in the camp the themes will be different. WF owns a center in the village. During the first month of the summer the camp will be more focused on cultural activities for the people and the youth of the village. Activities such as cultural coffees , international evenings, workshop which volunteers can develop, renovation work such us painting and cleaning the House and visual arts project such a sharing photography knowledge s, video filming and editing. During the last 2 months of the summer volunteers will work more on environmental tasks such as cleaning the coast line. During this time the local Youth goes back to school and is more difficult to gather people for cultural evening. Another reason to avoid environmental work during the first 2 months is due to the migrant birds known as CRIA in Iceland. About this time they are nesting and is not good to disturb the areas. At the end of August the fly back again and is perfect time for coastline cleaning. Also during this time volunteers will have the chance to share photo skills and video and edit and produce visual arts materials to be use afterwards on our website.This work camp is a way to enjoy an amazing time in Iceland with other international volunteers and to have an incredible experience where participants share their knowledge with each other while they are exploring creativity, environmental issues and intercultural learning.</descr_work>

			<descr_partner>To truly sense the remote beauty of the north-east, the charming little fishing village of Sorshofn on the north-eastern coast is the right place to go. The town of Sorshofn with its 388 inhabitants lies at the very tip of the Langanes peninsula. There are plenty of outdoor activities to choose from: hiking, salmon and trout fishing, as well as horse trekking in Iceland s most astonishing landscape. The Langanes Peninsula is also one of the best areas to spot Iceland s rich and varied birdlife. Sorshofn is within driving distance of some of Iceland s most prized natural pearls, such as Myvatn, renowned for its geothermal activity, and Dettifoss, one of Europe s highest and most spectacular waterfalls. This village has a beautiful natural harbour and the inhabitants  livelihood depends mostly on fishing, fish processing and commerce. In the month of June the sun never fully sets in the north.For additional information, visit: http://www.langanesbyggd.is/category.php?catID=17.</descr_partner>
			<descr_work>Most of the work will be cleaning and beautifying the town and the surrounding area. We will also continue to clean up the coastline and other environmental tasks such as planting trees, building hiking paths, taking old fences down, etc. The work available will depend on the weather condition and that s why we need to be flexible. Please keep in mind that the work might be physically hard and you should be prepared for unfriendly weather, even though it will be nice most of the time, hopefully.</descr_work>
			<descr_accomodation_and_food>We will stay at the local school, sleeping on mattresses on the floor. Participants are asked to bring a sleeping bag. Food will be provided for the duration of the workcamp and everyone is expected to do his/her fair share of the cleaning and cooking. It would be nice to share new and different dishes, so please remember to bring along recipes from your own countries</descr_accomodation_and_food>

			<descr_partner>Scoured by Ice Age glaciers, the dramatic east coast boasts long, narrow fjords with steep sides and jagged peaks which contrast with inland fertile farmlands. Natural harbours mean picture-postcard fishing villages and seemingly never-ending roads cross the region, providing beautiful sweeping views.  Fjaroabyggo  is an association of villages in the Eastern fjords of Iceland. It includes the towns of Eskifjorour, Faskruosfjorour, Mjoifjorour, Neskaupstaour, Reyoarfjorour and Stoovarfjorour, all tiny fishing villages with steep mountains towering just behind the houses. In this area you will see some of the features that make Iceland a unique place in the world: spectacular fjords with a rich sea life, a great variety of birdlife, and countless breathtaking hiking paths.

			<descr_work>This workcamp all is about awareness. The volunteers will be the leaders of environmental education sessions in high schools in Reykjavik. The main goal is to create awareness among children and teenagers and promote protecting the environment in daily life. The work will be divided between preparation of materials such as posters, brochure, info mobile centre with photos and explanations, power points, and videos. During the second week the volunteers will visit high schools to perform the session. During the camp the volunteers will enjoy a percussion workshop in order to give a small performance in the high school and catch the attention of the students.</descr_work>

			<descr_partner>Reykjavik is a city full of energy, just waiting for you to experience it. Powered by heat from the earth below, with ever-changing weather sweeping across the landscape, its natural features are matched by the energy of its residents.  Think of the qualities of a great city - fun, culture, nature, clean air - and Reykjavik has them in spades. All the advantages of a modern, forward-looking society are complemented by the beautiful natural setting. In a country of only just over 300,000 people, the Reykjavik Capital Area has a population of about 200,000. However, since it s the only major city in the country, Reykjavik has a lot of the amenities that you would only expect to find in a much larger center elsewhere in the world.Reykjavik is the world s northernmost capital city and is centred on the Seltjarnarnes Peninsula. Come at the right time of year, and in favourable conditions you will see the city s skyline silhouetted against the glowing, shimmering curtain of the aurora borealis, also known as the northern lights. Reykjavik is framed by the majestic Mt. Esja and the blue waters of Faxafloi Bay to the north, while rugged lava-fields spread to the southeast. On a clear sunny day, the Snaefellsjokull glacier glitters on the western horizon like a crystal.</descr_partner>
			<descr_work>During the workcamp the volunteers and the work will be focused on Latin America by having workshops of Latin- American music and dances. As well we will involve Latin- American people living in Reykjavik in order to provide the participants the opportunity to learn about Latin- American cuisine, get to know their culture and make video forums with movies that reflect the situation in the continent today in order to create debates concerning different issues. At the end of the work camp we will have a little Latin- American festival in downtown Reykjavik where we will show the outcome of the workshops, a performance of dances and music as well food, photos, and reflections about the situation in Latin America today and how young people should act in order to improve the current situation.</descr_work>

Volunteers need to bring their own sleeping bag and towels, but mattresses and bed linens are provided. Wireless internet access is provided free of charge, and volunteers also have free access to shared desktop computers in communal areas. The accommodation provided by Worldwide Friends Iceland for volunteers in Reykjavik is located within short walking distance of many urban amenities, including: banks, pharmacies, supermarkets, public swimming pools, restaurants, cafes, libraries, theaters, shops, museums, and bus stations.Food is included for the duration of the workcamp, however everyone is expected to do their fair share of the cooking and cleaning.

			<descr_partner>In Reykjavik you can easily feel the pure energy at the heart of Iceland s capital city - whether it springs from the underground boiling thermal energy or radiates from the green scenery surrounding the city. Think of the qualities of a great city - fun, space, clean air, nature, culture - and Reykjavik has them in spades. Reykjavik offers both the features of a modern and innovative society and the marvellous traits of a unique natural landscape. The population of the Reykjavik Area is about 200,000. Reykjavik is spread across a peninsula offering a panoramic view of the mountains and the Atlantic Ocean from nearly every part of the city. In the summer, you can sit by the harbour at midnight and watch the sun dip slightly below the horizon before it makes its way up again.The world s northernmost capital is framed by the majestic Mt. Esja, which keeps a watchful eye on the city, and the blue waters of Faxafloi Bay. On a sunny day, the mystical Snaefellsjokull glacier towers over the western horizon, while mountainous moonscapes spread to the southeast.</descr_partner>
			<descr_work>The purpose of this camp is to involve young international volunteers in a group experience where they can improve their communication and visual arts skills by capturing some memories in an unforgettable way using photographs and videos. Volunteers will put into action ideas about photography from capture to finished image.  In this camp, volunteers learn together from each other how to better express their vision and how to digitally edit images to highlight the same qualities that drew them to the scene to begin with. Volunteers will work on different themes, such as landscape, fishermen s life, light and colour, local lifestyle etc. In the evenings the volunteers will gather together to share photos and the camp will culminate in a photo exhibition.This work camp is a way to enjoy an amazing time in Iceland with other international volunteers and to have an incredible experience where participants share their knowledge on photography with each other while they are exploring creativity, environmental issues and intercultural learning. So don t worry if you re not an experienced photographer, because the workcamp doesn t require advanced knowledge and it isn t a competition. Please note that volunteers need to bring their own cameras to the workcamp. The volunteers should also keep in mind that the leaders are not professional photographers.</descr_work>

			<descr_partner>Scoured by Ice Age glaciers, the dramatic east coast boasts long, narrow fjords with steep sides and jagged peaks which contrast with inland fertile farmlands. Natural harbours mean picture-postcard fishing villages and seemingly never-ending roads cross the region, providing beautiful sweeping views.  Fjaroabyggo  is an association of villages in the Eastern fjords of Iceland. It includes the towns of Eskifjorour, Faskruosfjorour, Mjoifjorour, Neskaupstaour, Reyoarfjorour and Stoovarfjorour, all tiny fishing villages with steep mountains towering just behind the houses. In this area you will see some of the features that make Iceland a unique place in the world: spectacular fjords with a rich sea life, a great variety of birdlife, and countless breathtaking hiking paths. You will explore the area during your stay in the east.</descr_partner>

			<descr_partner>:  Hvalfjorour (Icelandic: Whale-fjord) is situated in the west of Iceland between Mosfellsbaer and Akranes. The fjord is approximately 30 km long and 5 km wide.The name Hvalfjorour is derived from the large number of whales which could be found and caught there. Until the 1980s, one of the biggest whaling stations in Iceland was located in this fjord. In the past the fjord also contained a large number of herring fisheries.A hiking trail to the highest waterfall in Iceland, Glymur, has its origin at the innermost end of the fjord.</descr_partner>
			<descr_work>Since the creation of Worldwide friends, the organization has been looking for the opportunity to set up a project to renovate and work at an old Icelandic farm.  The idea of renovating old spaces in the country side of Iceland and especially in areas where there isn t much population is one of the best ideas our organization could develop. In one hand we have the opportunity of giving life to an empty and old space, in the other hand we are bringing life back to the area with the spirit and the ideas of International volunteers which will be very much welcomed by the local community. The first part of this Project will consist on renovating and putting the farm in good shape. There are two building that we have to renovate. The first one is the main house where volunteers will live in the near future. The second house is the storage and workshops where volunteers will keep the paint and other materials.The work on this project is a mix of renovation work and gardening.We will also take care of the property, plant trees, cleaning the area, even cleaning the coast line around the fjord There are a lot farms in the area so the volunteers will have the chance to visit other farms around and therefore to learn about Icelandic farming methods.</descr_work>
			<descr_accomodation_and_food>We will be staying in the farm. Participants are asked to bring a sleeping bag.  Food will be provided for the duration of the workcamp and everyone is expected to do his/her fair share of the cooking/cleaning. It would be nice to try new and different dishes, so please remember to bring along recipes from your own countries.</descr_accomodation_and_food>
			<descr_location_and_leisure>We will explore the whole whale fjord and the surrounding area, including a hike to the highest waterfall in Iceland.WF Iceland will also organise reasonably-priced weekend excursions to some of the most popular, beautiful areas and natural wonders that Iceland has to offer. Excursions include unique Icelandic sights such as glacial lagoons, waterfalls, volcanic and geothermal areas, glaciers, geysirs, lava forests, hot-springs, rhyolite mountain ranges, steam-vents, or even icebergs.</descr_location_and_leisure>

			<descr_partner>Hverageroi is a small town of about 1,700 inhabitants that lies some 45 km east of Reykjavik. This friendly little community sits on top of a highly active geothermal field, which provides heat for hundreds of greenhouses where fruit, flowers and vegetables are produced throughout the year. Even bananas grow in these greenhouses The name Hverageroi means  hot springs garden.  Geothermal energy is Hverageroi s lifeblood, and you probably won t find such a natural wonder in the middle of a populated area anywhere else in the world. Nearby you will find an even more geothermally active site: Gufudalur, the lovely  Steam Valley  behind the town. This whole valley is full of hot springs, geysers, mud pots, fumaroles and steaming vents. Our host is the Rehabilitation and Health Clinic, which is a part of the Natural Health Association of Iceland.  Every year approximately 2,000 patients and other guests enjoy their diverse rehabilitation programs, which are focused on an approach that builds self-confidence and personal responsibility for the patients  own health. The Clinic has earned a solid reputation, both in Iceland and internationally, since its foundation in 1955 for personal and effective care of patients. It is the oldest and one of the two most important rehabilitation clinics in Iceland.</descr_partner>
			<descr_work>The Natural Health Association has a horticultural and environmental department, including forestry, gardening, and greenhouses, which is where Worldwide Friends volunteers work most of the time. The nature of the work depends largely on weather conditions, which can change quickly. Volunteers should bring clothes appropriate for outdoor work, but also clothes for working inside the warm greenhouses</descr_work>
			<descr_accomodation_and_food>Worldwide Friends volunteers stay in a fully equipped bungalow consisting of several double rooms. Volunteers need to bring their own sleeping bag, but mattresses are provided. Free wireless internet is available during evening hours, but volunteers need to bring their own laptops if they would like to connect to it.All meals are provided and cooked by our hosts, the Rehabilitation and Health Clinic. The menu for the project is primarily vegetarian, but two times a week it includes locally-caught fish.

However, since it s the only major city in the country, Reykjavik has a lot of the amenities that you would only expect to find in a much larger center elsewhere in the world. Reykjavik is the world s northernmost capital city and is centered on the Seltjarnarnes Peninsula. Come at the right time of year, and in favorable conditions you will see the city s skyline silhouetted against the glowing, shimmering curtain of the aurora borealis, also known as the northern lights. Reykjavik is framed by the majestic Mt. Esja and the blue waters of Faxafloi Bay to the north, while rugged lava-fields spread to the southeast. On a clear sunny day, the Snaefellsjokull glacier glitters on the western horizon like a crystal.</descr_partner>
			<descr_work>This workcamp all is about awareness. The volunteers will be the leaders of environmental education sessions in high schools in Reykjavik. The main goal is to create awareness among children and teenagers and promote protecting the environment in daily life. The work will be divided between preparation of materials such as posters, brochure, info mobile centre with photos and explanations, power points, and videos. During the second week the volunteers will visit high schools to perform the session. During the camp the volunteers will enjoy a percussion workshop in order to give a small performance in the high school and catch the attention of the students.</descr_work>
			<descr_accomodation_and_food>Worldwide Friends volunteers stay in one of several shared houses offering basic sleeping and cooking facilities in the heart of historical downtown Reykjavik. Volunteers need to bring their own sleeping bag and towels, but mattresses and bed linens are provided. Wireless internet access is provided free of charge, and volunteers also have free access to shared desktop computers in communal areas. The accommodation provided by Worldwide Friends Iceland for volunteers in Reykjavik is located within short walking distance of many urban amenities, including: banks, pharmacies, supermarkets, public swimming pools, restaurants, cafes, libraries, theaters, shops, museums, and bus stations. Food is included for the duration of the workcamp, however everyone is expected to do their fair share of the cooking and cleaning. Since it is always nice to try new and different dishes, volunteers are encouraged to bring along their favorite recipes from home</descr_accomodation_and_food>
			<descr_location_and_leisure>Worldwide Friends volunteers have free access to the local geothermally-heated swimming pools in Reykjavik. Traditionally, natural pools have played an important social role in Icelandic culture. Most Icelandic pools offer indoor and outdoor swimming, as well as hot tubs and saunas or steam rooms. On weekends, the central location of the accommodations is ideal for enjoying Reykjavik s amazing nightlife, which is world-renowned for its wide array of bars, clubs, and concerts. WF Iceland will also organise reasonably-priced weekend excursions to some of the most popular, beautiful areas and natural wonders that Iceland has to offer. Excursions include unique Icelandic sights such as glacial lagoons, waterfalls, volcanic and geothermal areas, glaciers, geysirs, lava forests, hot-springs, rhyolite mountain ranges, steam-vents, or even icebergs.</descr_location_and_leisure>

			<descr_partner>To truly sense the remote beauty of the north-east, the charming little fishing village of Sorshofn on the north-eastern coast is the right place to go. The town of Sorshofn with its 388 inhabitants lies at the very tip of the Langanes peninsula. There are plenty of outdoor activities to choose from: hiking, salmon and trout fishing, as well as horse trekking in Iceland s most astonishing landscape. The Langanes Peninsula is also one of the best areas to spot Iceland s rich and varied birdlife. Sorshofn is within driving distance of some of Iceland s most prized natural pearls, such as Myvatn, renowned for its geothermal activity, and Dettifoss, one of Europe s highest and most spectacular waterfalls. This village has a beautiful natural harbour and the inhabitants  livelihood depends mostly on fishing, fish processing and commerce. In the month of June the sun never fully sets in the north.For additional information, visit: http://www.langanesbyggd.is/category.php?catID=17.</descr_partner>
			<descr_work>Most of the work will be cleaning and beautifying the town and the surrounding area.

			<descr_partner>Hverageroi is a small town of about 1,700 inhabitants that lies some 45 km east of Reykjavik. This friendly little community sits on top of a highly active geothermal field, which provides heat for hundreds of greenhouses where fruit, flowers and vegetables are produced throughout the year. Even bananas grow in these greenhouses The name Hverageroi means  hot springs garden.  Geothermal energy is Hverageroi s lifeblood, and you probably won t find such a natural wonder in the middle of a populated area anywhere else in the world. Nearby you will find an even more geothermally active site: Gufudalur, the lovely  Steam Valley  behind the town. This whole valley is full of hot springs, geysers, mud pots, fumaroles and steaming vents. Our host is the Rehabilitation and Health Clinic, which is a part of the Natural Health Association of Iceland. Every year approximately 2,000 patients and other guests enjoy their diverse rehabilitation programs, which are focused on an approach that builds self-confidence and personal responsibility for the patients  own health. The Clinic has earned a solid reputation, both in Iceland and internationally, since its foundation in 1955 for personal and effective care of patients. It is the oldest and one of the two most important rehabilitation clinics in Iceland.</descr_partner>
			<descr_work>The Natural Health Association has a horticultural and environmental department, including forestry, gardening, and greenhouses, which is where Worldwide Friends volunteers work most of the time. The nature of the work depends largely on weather conditions, which can change quickly. Volunteers should bring clothes appropriate for outdoor work, but also clothes for working inside the warm greenhouses.</descr_work>
			<descr_accomodation_and_food>Worldwide Friends volunteers stay in a fully equipped bungalow consisting of several double rooms. Volunteers need to bring their own sleeping bag, but mattresses are provided. Free wireless internet is available during evening hours, but volunteers need to bring their own laptops if they would like to connect to it. All meals are provided and cooked by our hosts, the Rehabilitation and Health Clinic. The menu for the project is primarily vegetarian, but two times a week it includes locally-caught fish. The food at the Rehabilitation and Health Clinic is known throughout Iceland for its high quality.</descr_accomodation_and_food>

			<descr_partner>Raufarhofn, Thorshofn and Kopasker are there communities  located in the most northeastern part of Iceland. The geographic location of these villages makes life in winter very difficult and isolated from the rest of the Island. There are 600 people living between the 3  communities  in a square of 200 km.  WF Iceland has been running workcamps in Raufarhofn with the main goal of bringing life to the villages through international volunteering.</descr_partner>
			<descr_work>During this workcamp participants will take part in the production of a video documentary which will be focused on how Icelandic people live and survive in isolated rural areas.  It will be a mix of landscape shots and interviews of local people in order to find out how they feel about living there and what they think about international volunteers coming to the village. Another part of the project will be focused on the Auroras Borealis. During this time of the year it is very easy to see and experience this amazing spectacular phenomenon. Volunteers will be involved in a Time-Lapse project in order to catch the lights and have a common visual arts project.During this time of the year the weather in Raufarhofn can be very unfriendly and cold. We strongly recommend to bring really warm and waterproof clothes. You should also be aware of the fact that the weather can get so extreme that it will not allow us to go out of the accommodation. Don t forget to bring your cameras and tripods since big parts of the project are focused on Auroras hunting. The tripod is an essential tool to keep the camera working in a long exposure. You will not be able to enjoy and work in this part of the project without tripod So do not forget itThe third part of this workcamp will concentrate on intercultural learning and exchange. Every evening a different country will cook for the rest of the Group and will be in charge of presenting their origin country and culture in a non formal way. It could be a presentation, games, theater or however you would like to show it. Therefore we recommend to bring food, photos or whatever you think is important and nice for the Worldwide evenings. This work camp is a way to enjoy an amazing time in Iceland with other international volunteers and to have an incredible experience where participants share their knowledge with each other while they are exploring creativity, environmental issues and intercultural learning.</descr_work>
			<descr_accomodation_and_food>Worldwide Friends volunteers stay in an indoor community facility offering basic facilities. Beds are provided, however volunteers should bring their own warm sleeping bags. Food is included for the duration of the workcamp, however everyone is expected to do their fair share of the cooking and cleaning. Since it is always nice to try new and different dishes, volunteers are encouraged to bring along their favorite recipes from home  There will be almost no internet connection available and if so it will be in a very simple base. So please make yourself concious of isolation for 2 weeks.</descr_accomodation_and_food>
			<descr_location_and_leisure>The village of Raufarhofn is the community that lies farthest north in Iceland. It is located in the eastern part of Melrakkasletta close to the Arctic Circle. The population of Raufarhofn is about 200 and most of the people there earn their living from fishing and fish processing. The harbor is very beautiful and partly shaped by nature itself. A wide and untouched open area surrounds the village with a lot of birds and varied vegetation. The coastline with its inlets and creeks is filled with driftwood and reaches out into the Arctic Sea. Away and on the surface of the sea various sea-birds will be spotted and an occasional seal. On the beach waders strut and inland on the grassy moorlands there are dozens of lakes filled with trout. In the vicinity many species of ducks, waders and species that favor heaths and moorlands may be observed.Worldwide Friends volunteers have free access to the local swimming pool. Traditionally, natural pools have played an important social role in Icelandic culture. Most Icelandic pools offer indoor and outdoor swimming, as well as hot tubs and saunas or steam rooms.</descr_location_and_leisure>

			<descr_partner>In Reykjavik you can easily feel the pure energy at the heart of Iceland s capital city - whether it springs from the underground boiling thermal energy or radiates from the green scenery surrounding the city. Think of the qualities of a great city - fun, space, clean air, nature, culture - and Reykjavik has them in spades. Reykjavik offers both the features of a modern and innovative society and the marvellous traits of a unique natural landscape. The population of the Reykjavik Area is about 200,000. Reykjavik is spread across a peninsula offering a panoramic view of the mountains and the Atlantic Ocean from nearly every part of the city. In the summer, you can sit by the harbour at midnight and watch the sun dip slightly below the horizon before it makes its way up again.The world s northernmost capital is framed by the majestic Mt. Esja, which keeps a watchful eye on the city, and the blue waters of Faxafloi Bay. On a sunny day, the mystical Snaefellsjokull glacier towers over the western horizon, while mountainous moonscapes spread to the southeast.</descr_partner>
			<descr_work>Every year WF Iceland is hosting hundreds of international volunteers participating in projects all round the island. WF Iceland publishes a magazine called UNA where people can read about the life of the organization.In the beginning of the project volunteers will receive an introduction about the tasks - afterwards we will visit other WF workcamps located in Reykjavik. This is a great opportunity to step into different projects and even participate in their work a little bit. The group will take photos and make videos and interviews with volunteers, local hosts and people living in the area. The outcome will be published in the UNA WF magazine.At the end of the project we will prepare the final version of the magazine and publish it.</descr_work>
			<descr_accomodation_and_food>Worldwide Friends volunteers stay in one of several shared houses offering basic sleeping and cooking facilities in the heart of historical downtown Reykjavik. Volunteers need to bring their own sleeping bag and towels, but mattresses and bed linens are provided.

			<descr_partner>Reykjavik is a city full of energy, just waiting for you to experience it. Powered by heat from the earth below, with ever-changing weather sweeping across the landscape, its natural features are matched by the energy of its residents.  Think of the qualities of a great city - fun, culture, nature, clean air - and Reykjavik has them in spades. All the advantages of a modern, forward-looking society are complemented by the beautiful natural setting. In a country of only just over 300,000 people, the Reykjavik Capital Area has a population of about 200,000. However, since it s the only major city in the country, Reykjavik has a lot of the amenities that you would only expect to find in a much larger center elsewhere in the world.Reykjavik is the world s northernmost capital city and is centred on the Seltjarnarnes Peninsula. Come at the right time of year, and in favourable conditions you will see the city s skyline silhouetted against the glowing, shimmering curtain of the aurora borealis, also known as the northern lights. Reykjavik is framed by the majestic Mt. Esja and the blue waters of Faxafloi Bay to the north, while rugged lava-fields spread to the southeast. On a clear sunny day, the Snaefellsjokull glacier glitters on the western horizon like a crystal.</descr_partner>
			<descr_work>During the workcamp the volunteers and the work will be focused on Africa by having workshops of West African percussion instruments and dances in cooperation with http://www.kramhusid.is/. As well we will involve Africans living in Reykjavik in order to provide the participants the opportunity to learn about African cuisine, get to know them and make video forums with movies that reflect the situation in the continent today in order to create debates concerning different issues. At the end of the work camp we will organize a little African festival in downtown Reykjavik where we will show the outcome of the workshops, a performance of dances and percussion as well food, photos, and reflections about the situation in Africa today and how young people should act in order to improve the current situation.</descr_work>

			<descr_partner>Scoured by Ice Age glaciers, the dramatic east coast boasts long, narrow fjords with steep sides and jagged peaks which contrast with inland fertile farmlands. Natural harbors mean picture-postcard fishing villages and seemingly never-ending roads cross the region, providing beautiful sweeping views.  Fjaroabyggo  is an association of villages in the Eastern fjords of Iceland. It includes the towns of Eskifjorour, Faskruosfjorour, Mjoifjorour, Neskaupstaour, Reyoarfjorour and Stoovarfjorour, all tiny fishing villages with steep mountains towering just behind the houses. In this area you will see some of the features that make Iceland a unique place in the world: spectacular fjords with a rich sea life, a great variety of bird life, and countless breathtaking hiking paths. You will explore the area during your stay in the east.</descr_partner>
			<descr_work>Most of the work will consist of cleaning and beautifying the towns and the surrounding area. We will also do some other environmental tasks for example clean the coastline, plant trees or build hiking paths. Our work will also depend on weather conditions and that s why we have to be flexible. Please keep in mind that the work might be physically hard and you should be prepared for unfriendly weather, even though, hope- fully, it will be nice most of the time. This is a perfect camp for people who like outdoor work and physical challenges</descr_work>

			<descr_partner>In Reykjavik you can easily feel the pure energy at the heart of Iceland s capital city - whether it springs from the underground boiling thermal energy or radiates from the green scenery surrounding the city. Think of the qualities of a great city - fun, space, clean air, nature, culture - and Reykjavik has them in spades. Reykjavik offers both the features of a modern and innovative society and the marvellous traits of a unique natural landscape. The population of the Reykjavik Area is about 200,000. Reykjavik is spread across a peninsula offering a panoramic view of the mountains and the Atlantic Ocean from nearly every part of the city. In the summer, you can sit by the harbour at midnight and watch the sun dip slightly below the horizon before it makes its way up again.The world s northernmost capital is framed by the majestic Mt. Esja, which keeps a watchful eye on the city, and the blue waters of Faxafloi Bay. On a sunny day, the mystical Snaefellsjokull glacier towers over the western horizon, while mountainous moonscapes spread to the southeast.</descr_partner>
			<descr_work>The purpose of this camp is to involve young international volunteers in a group experience where they can improve their communication and visual arts skills by capturing some memories in an unforgettable way using photographs and videos. Volunteers will put into action ideas about photography from capture to finished image.  In this camp, volunteers learn together from each other how to better express their vision and how to digitally edit images to highlight the same qualities that drew them to the scene to begin with. Volunteers will work on different themes, such as landscape, fishermen s life, light and colour, local lifestyle etc. In the evenings the volunteers will gather together to share photos and the camp will culminate in a photo exhibition.This work camp is a way to enjoy an amazing time in Iceland with other international volunteers and to have an incredible experience where participants share their knowledge on photography with each other while they are exploring creativity, environmental issues and intercultural learning. So don t worry if you re not an experienced photographer, because the workcamp doesn t require advanced knowledge and it isn t a competition. Please note that volunteers need to bring their own cameras to the workcamp. The volunteers should also keep in mind that the leaders are not professional photographers.</descr_work>

			<descr_partner>The village of Raufarhofn is the community that lies farthest north in Iceland. It is located in the eastern part of Melrakkasletta close to the Arctic Circle. The population of Raufarhofn is about 200 and most of the people there earn their living from fishing and fish processing. The harbor is very beautiful and partly shaped by nature itself. A wide and untouched open area surrounds the village with a lot of birds and varied vegetation. In summer one will observe wild migratory birds within the village being a part of the village life with the villagers most often waking up in the morning to the songs of birds. The coastline with its inlets and creeks is filled with driftwood and reaches out into the Arctic Sea. Away and on the surface of the sea various sea-birds will be spotted and an occasional seal. On the beach waders strut and inland on the grassy moorlands there are dozens of lakes filled with trout. In the vicinity many species of ducks, waders and species that favor heaths and moorlands may be observed.</descr_partner>
			<descr_work>the purpose of this camp is very diverse. During these camp volunteers will be able to cooperate in different tasks. Depending to the season or month where volunteers will participate in the camp the themes will be different. WF owns a center in the village. During the first month of the summer the camp will be more focused on cultural activities for the people and the youth of the village. Activities such as cultural coffees , international evenings, workshop which volunteers can develop, renovation work such us painting and cleaning the House and visual arts project such a sharing photography knowledge s, video filming and editing. During the last 2 months of the summer volunteers will work more on environmental tasks such as cleaning the coast line. During this time the local Youth goes back to school and is more difficult to gather people for cultural evening. Another reason to avoid environmental work during the first 2 months is due to the migrant birds known as CRIA in Iceland. About this time they are nesting and is not good to disturb the areas. At the end of August the fly back again and is perfect time for coastline cleaning. Also during this time volunteers will have the chance to share photo skills and video and edit and produce visual arts materials to be use afterwards on our website.This work camp is a way to enjoy an amazing time in Iceland with other international volunteers and to have an incredible experience where participants share their knowledge with each other while they are exploring creativity, environmental issues and intercultural learning.</descr_work>

			<descr_partner>Hverageroi is a small town of about 1,700 inhabitants that lies some 45 km east of Reykjavik. This friendly little community sits on top of a highly active geothermal field, which provides heat for hundreds of greenhouses where fruit, flowers and vegetables are produced throughout the year. Even bananas grow in these greenhouses The name Hverageroi means  hot springs garden.  Geothermal energy is Hverageroi s lifeblood, and you probably won t find such a natural wonder in the middle of a populated area anywhere else in the world. Nearby you will find an even more geothermally active site: Gufudalur, the lovely  Steam Valley  behind the town. This whole valley is full of hot springs, geysers, mud pots, fumaroles and steaming vents. Our host is the Rehabilitation and Health Clinic, which is a part of the Natural Health Association of Iceland. Every year approximately 2,000 patients and other guests enjoy their diverse rehabilitation programs, which are focused on an approach that builds self-confidence and personal responsibility for the patients  own health. The Clinic has earned a solid reputation, both in Iceland and internationally, since its foundation in 1955 for personal and effective care of patients. It is the oldest and one of the two most important rehabilitation clinics in Iceland.</descr_partner>
			<descr_work>The Natural Health Association has a horticultural and environmental department, including forestry, gardening, and greenhouses, which is where Worldwide Friends volunteers work most of the time. The nature of the work depends largely on weather conditions, which can change quickly. Volunteers should bring clothes appropriate for outdoor work, but also clothes for working inside the warm greenhouses.</descr_work>
			<descr_accomodation_and_food>Worldwide Friends volunteers stay in a fully equipped bungalow consisting of several double rooms. Volunteers need to bring their own sleeping bag, but mattresses are provided. Free wireless internet is available during evening hours, but volunteers need to bring their own laptops if they would like to connect to it. All meals are provided and cooked by our hosts, the Rehabilitation and Health Clinic. The menu for the project is primarily vegetarian, but two times a week it includes locally-caught fish. The food at the Rehabilitation and Health Clinic is known throughout Iceland for its high quality.</descr_accomodation_and_food>

			<descr_partner>:  Hvalfjorour (Icelandic: Whale-fjord) is situated in the west of Iceland between Mosfellsbaer and Akranes. The fjord is approximately 30 km long and 5 km wide.The name Hvalfjorour is derived from the large number of whales which could be found and caught there. Until the 1980s, one of the biggest whaling stations in Iceland was located in this fjord. In the past the fjord also contained a large number of herring fisheries.A hiking trail to the highest waterfall in Iceland, Glymur, has its origin at the innermost end of the fjord.</descr_partner>
			<descr_work>Since the creation of Worldwide friends, the organization has been looking for the opportunity to set up a project to renovate and work at an old Icelandic farm.  The idea of renovating old spaces in the country side of Iceland and especially in areas where there isn t much population is one of the best ideas our organization could develop. In one hand we have the opportunity of giving life to an empty and old space, in the other hand we are bringing life back to the area with the spirit and the ideas of International volunteers which will be very much welcomed by the local community. The first part of this Project will consist on renovating and putting the farm in good shape. There are two building that we have to renovate. The first one is the main house where volunteers will live in the near future. The second house is the storage and workshops where volunteers will keep the paint and other materials.The work on this project is a mix of renovation work and gardening.We will also take care of the property, plant trees, cleaning the area, even cleaning the coast line around the fjord There are a lot farms in the area so the volunteers will have the chance to visit other farms around and therefore to learn about Icelandic farming methods.</descr_work>
			<descr_accomodation_and_food>We will be staying in the farm. Participants are asked to bring a sleeping bag.  Food will be provided for the duration of the workcamp and everyone is expected to do his/her fair share of the cooking/cleaning. It would be nice to try new and different dishes, so please remember to bring along recipes from your own countries.</descr_accomodation_and_food>
			<descr_location_and_leisure>We will explore the whole whale fjord and the surrounding area, including a hike to the highest waterfall in Iceland.WF Iceland will also organise reasonably-priced weekend excursions to some of the most popular, beautiful areas and natural wonders that Iceland has to offer. Excursions include unique Icelandic sights such as glacial lagoons, waterfalls, volcanic and geothermal areas, glaciers, geysirs, lava forests, hot-springs, rhyolite mountain ranges, steam-vents, or even icebergs.</descr_location_and_leisure>

			<descr_partner>Hverageroi is a small town of about 1,700 inhabitants that lies some 45 km east of Reykjavik. This friendly little community sits on top of a highly active geothermal field, which provides heat for hundreds of greenhouses where fruit, flowers and vegetables are produced throughout the year. Even bananas grow in these greenhouses The name Hverageroi means  hot springs garden.  Geothermal energy is Hverageroi s lifeblood, and you probably won t find such a natural wonder in the middle of a populated area anywhere else in the world. Nearby you will find an even more geothermally active site: Gufudalur, the lovely  Steam Valley  behind the town. This whole valley is full of hot springs, geysers, mud pots, fumaroles and steaming vents. Our host is the Rehabilitation and Health Clinic, which is a part of the Natural Health Association of Iceland.  Every year approximately 2,000 patients and other guests enjoy their diverse rehabilitation programs, which are focused on an approach that builds self-confidence and personal responsibility for the patients  own health. The Clinic has earned a solid reputation, both in Iceland and internationally, since its foundation in 1955 for personal and effective care of patients. It is the oldest and one of the two most important rehabilitation clinics in Iceland.</descr_partner>
			<descr_work>The Natural Health Association has a horticultural and environmental department, including forestry, gardening, and greenhouses, which is where Worldwide Friends volunteers work most of the time. The nature of the work depends largely on weather conditions, which can change quickly. Volunteers should bring clothes appropriate for outdoor work, but also clothes for working inside the warm greenhouses</descr_work>
			<descr_accomodation_and_food>Worldwide Friends volunteers stay in a fully equipped bungalow consisting of several double rooms. Volunteers need to bring their own sleeping bag, but mattresses are provided. Free wireless internet is available during evening hours, but volunteers need to bring their own laptops if they would like to connect to it.All meals are provided and cooked by our hosts, the Rehabilitation and Health Clinic. The menu for the project is primarily vegetarian, but two times a week it includes locally-caught fish. The food at the Rehabilitation and Health Clinic is known throughout Iceland for its high quality.</descr_accomodation_and_food>
			<descr_location_and_leisure>Worldwide Friends volunteers have free access to the local geothermally-heated swimming pools. Traditionally, natural pools have played an important social role in Icelandic culture. Most Icelandic pools offer indoor and outdoor swimming, as well as hot tubs and saunas or steam rooms. Hverageroi is known for having great areas for hiking, including a river heated by hot springs.WF Iceland will also organise reasonably-priced weekend excursions to some of the most popular, beautiful areas and natural wonders that Iceland has to offer.

			<descr_partner>Do you want to travel in the east of Iceland and at the same time participate in a very important project?The biggest and best known project of our organization is the  Clean Up the Coastline  (CUC) project. We have for the last six years been cleaning the coastline of Iceland and we will continue that work for the next four years, a part of this is to locate all items on the coastline which are too big to move by hands.</descr_partner>
			<descr_work>we will do a survey for a monitoring of marine litter in several places on the coastline.We will clean certain areas (position recorded by GPS on our  CUC map ) in different parts of Iceland and collect all the trash on the beach and classify it in a standard form. We will make photos of the coastline,This project provides us the standard methodology needed to produce some serious data. At the end, we will create a scientific data useful to know more about the pollution in the oceans and on the coastline. Take a look at http://cleanupthecoastline.wordpress.com/ for more information.The marine area around Iceland is regarded as one of the cleanest of the world. Nevertheless, marine litter such as persistent organic pollutants, heavy metals or hydrocarbons is constantly contaminating Iceland s shore. A large-scale surface of the Icelandic coastline is concerned by this pollution and some beaches are even fully covered by trash, mainly caused by poorly managed landfills close by.</descr_work>
			<descr_accomodation_and_food>The group will be stay in the accommodation of our workcamps in Eskifjorour. When we are travelling we might stay in tents which will be provided by WF Iceland or in community places.The food will be provided for the duration of the work camp and everyone is expected to do their fair share of the cooking/cleaning. It would be nice to share new and different dishes, so please remember to bring along recipes from your own countries.</descr_accomodation_and_food>
			<descr_location_and_leisure>We will do some hikes in different areas in Iceland. In some places we will have a free entrance to the swimming pools. This camp is also On the move so you will travel a lot during the camp and see beautiful places.</descr_location_and_leisure>
			<descr_requirements>Volunteers with good computer skills, interested in scientific work and/or photographing are very much welcome to this camp. It is also important that the volunteers are in good shape because we will do a lot of hiking and outdoor activities in this camp.</descr_requirements>

			<descr_partner>Project and location: Reykjavik is a city full of energy, just waiting for you to experience it. Powered by heat from the earth below, with ever-changing weather sweeping across the landscape, its natural features are matched by the energy of its residents.  Think of the qualities of a great city - fun, culture, nature, clean air - and Reykjavik has them in spades. All the advantages of a modern, forward-looking society are complemented by the beautiful natural setting. In a country of only just over 300,000 people, the Reykjavik Capital Area has a population of about 200,000. However, since it s the only major city in the country, Reykjavik has a lot of the amenities that you would only expect to find in a much larger center elsewhere in the world.Reykjavik is the world s northernmost capital city and is centred on the Seltjarnarnes Peninsula. Come at the right time of year, and in favourable conditions you will see the city s skyline silhouetted against the glowing, shimmering curtain of the aurora borealis, also known as the northern lights. Reykjavik is framed by the majestic Mt. Esja and the blue waters of Faxafloi Bay to the north, while rugged lava-fields spread to the southeast. On a clear sunny day, the Snaefellsjokull glacier glitters on the western horizon like a crystal. Reykjavik Culture Night has become an essential part of cultural life in Iceland with thousands of people strolling down the streets of the city on this exciting and eventful night. Culture Night offers a chance to enjoy a variety of activities ranging from traditional shows and exhibitions to more unusual happenings. A number of cultural institutions such as galleries, ateliers, shops, cafes, churches, restaurants and bars in downtown of Reykjavik stay open until late. The immensely popular Reykjavik Marathon takes place on the same day and we really encourage our volunteers to participate in that.</descr_partner>
			<descr_work>Our work during this camp will mostly be beautifying the city center and helping the local authorities to make it a better place to stay. This includes various types of environmental tasks as well as e.g. cleaning tasks and painting old houses. We will also have workshops dedicated to different kinds of art. On 24th of August, we will take part in Reykjaviks Cultural Night, performing in the streets and enjoying Iceland s biggest cultural event.</descr_work>
			<descr_accomodation_and_food>Worldwide Friends volunteers stay in one of several shared houses offering basic sleeping and cooking facilities in the heart of historical downtown Reykjavik. Volunteers need to bring their own sleeping bag and towels, but mattresses and bed linens are provided. Wireless internet access is provided free of charge, and volunteers also have free access to shared desktop computers in communal areas. The accommodation provided by Worldwide Friends Iceland for volunteers in Reykjavik is located within short walking distance of many urban amenities, including: banks, pharmacies, supermarkets, public swimming pools, restaurants, cafes, libraries, theatres, shops, museums, and bus stations.Food is included for the duration of the workcamp, however everyone is expected to do their fair share of the cooking and cleaning.

Traditionally, natural pools have played an important social role in Icelandic culture. Most Icelandic pools offer indoor and outdoor swimming, as well as hot tubs and saunas or steam rooms. On weekends, the central location of the accommodations is ideal for enjoying Reykjavik s amazing nightlife, which is world-renowned for its wide array of bars, clubs, and concerts. WF Iceland will also organise reasonably-priced weekend excursions to some of the most popular, beautiful areas and natural wonders that Iceland has to offer. Excursions include unique Icelandic sights such as glacial lagoons, waterfalls, volcanic and geothermal areas, glaciers, geysers, lava forests, hot-springs, rhyolite mountain ranges, steam-vents, or even icebergs.</descr_location_and_leisure>

			<descr_partner>Hverageroi is a small town of about 1,700 inhabitants that lies some 45 km east of Reykjavik. This friendly little community sits on top of a highly active geothermal field, which provides heat for hundreds of greenhouses where fruit, flowers and vegetables are produced throughout the year. Even bananas grow in these greenhouses The name Hverageroi means  hot springs garden.  Geothermal energy is Hverageroi s lifeblood, and you probably won t find such a natural wonder in the middle of a populated area anywhere else in the world. Nearby you will find an even more geothermally active site: Gufudalur, the lovely  Steam Valley  behind the town. This whole valley is full of hot springs, geysers, mud pots, fumaroles and steaming vents.The Gardening and Flower festival in Hverageroi  will take place from the 22nd to the 24th of June.  This year the theme of the festival will be  Circus  so volunteers interested in that topic are very much welcome. You can find more information in the website http://www.blomibae.is</descr_partner>

			<descr_partner>The village of Raufarhofn is the community that lies farthest north in Iceland. It is located in the eastern part of Melrakkasletta close to the Arctic Circle. The population of Raufarhofn is about 200 and most of the people there earn their living from fishing and fish processing. The harbor is very beautiful and partly shaped by nature itself. A wide and untouched open area surrounds the village with a lot of birds and varied vegetation. In summer one will observe wild migratory birds within the village being a part of the village life with the villagers most often waking up in the morning to the songs of birds. The coastline with its inlets and creeks is filled with driftwood and reaches out into the Arctic Sea. Away and on the surface of the sea various sea-birds will be spotted and an occasional seal. On the beach waders strut and inland on the grassy moorlands there are dozens of lakes filled with trout. In the vicinity many species of ducks, waders and species that favor heaths and moorlands may be observed.</descr_partner>
			<descr_work>the purpose of this camp is very diverse. During these camp volunteers will be able to cooperate in different tasks. Depending to the season or month where volunteers will participate in the camp the themes will be different. WF owns a center in the village. During the first month of the summer the camp will be more focused on cultural activities for the people and the youth of the village. Activities such as cultural coffees , international evenings, workshop which volunteers can develop, renovation work such us painting and cleaning the House and visual arts project such a sharing photography knowledge s, video filming and editing. During the last 2 months of the summer volunteers will work more on environmental tasks such as cleaning the coast line. During this time the local Youth goes back to school and is more difficult to gather people for cultural evening. Another reason to avoid environmental work during the first 2 months is due to the migrant birds known as CRIA in Iceland. About this time they are nesting and is not good to disturb the areas. At the end of August the fly back again and is perfect time for coastline cleaning. Also during this time volunteers will have the chance to share photo skills and video and edit and produce visual arts materials to be use afterwards on our website.This work camp is a way to enjoy an amazing time in Iceland with other international volunteers and to have an incredible experience where participants share their knowledge with each other while they are exploring creativity, environmental issues and intercultural learning.</descr_work>

			<descr_partner>changing weather sweeping across the landscape, its natural features are matched by the energy of its residents.  Think of the qualities of a great city - fun, culture, nature, clean air - and Reykjavik has them in spades. All the advantages of a modern, forward-looking society are complemented by the beautiful natural setting. In a country of only just over 300,000 people, the Reykjavik Capital Area has a population of about 200,000. However, since it s the only major city in the country, Reykjavik has a lot of the amenities that you would only expect to find in a much larger center elsewhere in the world.Reykjavik is the world s northernmost capital city and is centred on the Seltjarnarnes Peninsula. Come at the right time of year, and in favourable conditions you will see the city s skyline silhouetted against the glowing, shimmering curtain of the aurora borealis, also known as the northern lights. Reykjavik is framed by the majestic Mt. Esja and the blue waters of Faxafloi Bay to the north, while rugged lava-fields spread to the southeast. On a clear sunny day, the Snaefellsjokull glacier glitters on the western horizon like a crystal. The Gay Pride festival in Reykjavik will take place in the last days of the workcamp from 06/08 until 11/08. During those days Reykjavik is full of life, a huge, merry and colourful Gay Parade goes through the centre of town and a grand outdoor concert attended by over seventy thousand people i lesbians, gays, bisexuals, transgender and straight, friends, relatives, fellow citizens and numerous foreign visitors - showing solidarity with the gay cause. More information on http://www.gaypride.is/</descr_partner>
			<descr_work>Our work during this camp will mostly be beautifying the city center and helping the local authorities to make it a better place to stay. This includes various types of environmental tasks as well as e.g. cleaning tasks and painting old houses. We will be working outside and help other environmental departments to take care of all the parks and green spots in the heart of Reykjavik.</descr_work>

			<descr_partner>Hvalfjorour (Icelandic: Whale-fjord) is situated in the west of Iceland between Mosfellsbaer and Akranes. The fjord is approximately 30 km long and 5 km wide.The name Hvalfjorour is derived from the large number of whales which could be found and caught there. Until the 1980s, one of the biggest whaling stations in Iceland was located in this fjord. In the past the fjord also contained a large number of herring fisheries.A hiking trail to the highest waterfall in Iceland, Glymur, has its origin at the innermost end of the fjord.</descr_partner>
			<descr_work>Since the creation of Worldwide friends, the organization has been looking for the opportunity to set up a project to renovate and work at an old Icelandic farm.  The idea of renovating old spaces in the country side of Iceland and especially in areas where there isn t much population is one of the best ideas our organization could develop. In one hand we have the opportunity of giving life to an empty and old space, in the other hand we are bringing life back to the area with the spirit and the ideas of International volunteers which will be very much welcomed by the local community. The first part of this Project will consist on renovating and putting the farm in good shape. There are two building that we have to renovate. The first one is the main house where volunteers will live in the near future. The second house is the storage and workshops where volunteers will keep the paint and other materials.The work on this project is a mix of renovation work and gardening.We will also take care of the property, plant trees, cleaning the area, even cleaning the coast line around the fjord There are a lot farms in the area so the volunteers will have the chance to visit other farms around and therefore to learn about Icelandic farming methods.</descr_work>
			<descr_accomodation_and_food>We will be staying in the farm. Participants are asked to bring a sleeping bag.  Food will be provided for the duration of the workcamp and everyone is expected to do his/her fair share of the cooking/cleaning. It would be nice to try new and different dishes, so please remember to bring along recipes from your own countries.</descr_accomodation_and_food>
			<descr_location_and_leisure>We will explore the whole whale fjord and the surrounding area, including a hike to the highest waterfall in Iceland.WF Iceland will also organise reasonably-priced weekend excursions to some of the most popular, beautiful areas and natural wonders that Iceland has to offer. Excursions include unique Icelandic sights such as glacial lagoons, waterfalls, volcanic and geothermal areas, glaciers, geysirs, lava forests, hot-springs, rhyolite mountain ranges, steam-vents, or even icebergs.</descr_location_and_leisure>

			<descr_partner>Hverageroi is a small town of about 1,700 inhabitants that lies some 45 km east of Reykjavik. This friendly little community sits on top of a highly active geothermal field, which provides heat for hundreds of greenhouses where fruit, flowers and vegetables are produced throughout the year. Even bananas grow in these greenhouses The name Hverageroi means  hot springs garden.  Geothermal energy is Hverageroi s lifeblood, and you probably won t find such a natural wonder in the middle of a populated area anywhere else in the world. Nearby you will find an even more geothermally active site: Gufudalur, the lovely  Steam Valley  behind the town. This whole valley is full of hot springs, geysers, mud pots, fumaroles and steaming vents. Our host is the Rehabilitation and Health Clinic, which is a part of the Natural Health Association of Iceland. Every year approximately 2,000 patients and other guests enjoy their diverse rehabilitation programs, which are focused on an approach that builds self-confidence and personal responsibility for the patients  own health. The Clinic has earned a solid reputation, both in Iceland and internationally, since its foundation in 1955 for personal and effective care of patients. It is the oldest and one of the two most important rehabilitation clinics in Iceland.</descr_partner>

			<descr_partner>Scoured by Ice Age glaciers, the dramatic east coast boasts long, narrow fjords with steep sides and jagged peaks which contrast with inland fertile farmlands. Natural harbours mean picture-postcard fishing villages and seemingly never-ending roads cross the region, providing beautiful sweeping views.  Fjaroabyggo  is an association of villages in the Eastern fjords of Iceland. It includes the towns of Eskifjorour, Faskruosfjorour, Mjoifjorour, Neskaupstaour, Reyoarfjorour and Stoovarfjorour, all tiny fishing villages with steep mountains towering just behind the houses. In this area you will see some of the features that make Iceland a unique place in the world: spectacular fjords with a rich sea life, a great variety of birdlife, and countless breathtaking hiking paths. You will explore the area during your stay in the east.</descr_partner>
			<descr_work>Most of the work will consist of cleaning and beautifying the towns and the surrounding area. We will also do some other environmental tasks for example clean the coastline, plant trees or build hiking paths. Our work will also depend on weather conditions and that s why we have to be flexible. Please keep in mind that the work might be physically hard and you should be prepared for unfriendly weather, even though, hope- fully, it will be nice most of the time.

			<descr_partner>Katla Geopark  http://www.katlageopark.is/  is Icelands first geopark and it opens up a natural wonderland to the visitor. A top priority of the park is to protect the natural environment, promote local sustainable development, introduce local culture and place a strong emphasis on nature tourism.Katla Geopark got its name from one of its most known volcanoes, Katla which is under the glacier Mirdalsjokull. The geopark is 9542 km2 or around 9,3  of the total area of Iceland with population around 2700.Katla Geopark is in every sense the land of ice and fire, with its towering glaciers and active volcanoes. These forces have been shaping the land for thousands of years and the nearest examples of that are the powerful eruptions in Eyjafjallajokull 2010 and Grimsvotn 2011. But there is also more amazing landscapes in the area, mountains, lakes, black sandy beaches, green pastures and meadows, powerful glacial rivers, beautiful waterfalls and vast lava fields.Katla Geopark is accessible all year round, and each season has its own magical charm in this spectacular natural paradise.Vik in Mirdalur is Iceland s most southerly village, bordered by the glacial river Jokulsa to the west and the river Blautakvisl to the east. It s northern border is the Mirdalsjokull glacier, which caps the volcanic Mt. Katla, while its southern limits are black sands and the rolling Atlantic waves. The district lives mainly by agriculture. Although this community of 600 inhabitants faces the open Atlantic, Vik is the only seaside settlement in Iceland left without a harbour due to natural circumstances. The natural beauty of the area is spectacular. Just east of the village s outskirts lies one of Europe s biggest arctic tern breeding grounds. South of Vik is a beautiful beach, which is one of the world s ten best island beaches . A short hike within the close vicinity of Vik is sure to satisfy all serious nature lovers and bird watchers. Vik and its surroundings is one of the main bird life areas in Iceland.</descr_partner>

			<descr_partner>Scoured by Ice Age glaciers, the dramatic east coast boasts long, narrow fjords with steep sides and jagged peaks which contrast with inland fertile farmlands. Natural harbors mean picture-postcard fishing villages and seemingly never-ending roads cross the region, providing beautiful sweeping views.  Fjaroabyggo  is an association of villages in the Eastern fjords of Iceland. It includes the towns of Eskifjorour, Faskruosfjorour, Mjoifjorour, Neskaupstaour, Reyoarfjorour and Stoovarfjorour, all tiny fishing villages with steep mountains towering just behind the houses. In this area you will see some of the features that make Iceland a unique place in the world: spectacular fjords with a rich sea life, a great variety of bird life, and countless breathtaking hiking paths. You will explore the area during your stay in the east.</descr_partner>
			<descr_work>Most of the work will consist of cleaning and beautifying the towns and the surrounding area. We will also do some other environmental tasks for example clean the coastline, plant trees or build hiking paths. Our work will also depend on weather conditions and that s why we have to be flexible. Please keep in mind that the work might be physically hard and you should be prepared for unfriendly weather, even though, hope- fully, it will be nice most of the time. This is a perfect camp for people who like outdoor work and physical challenges</descr_work>

			<descr_partner>In Reykjavik you can easily feel the pure energy at the heart of Iceland s capital city - whether it springs from the underground boiling thermal energy or radiates from the green scenery surrounding the city. Think of the qualities of a great city - fun, space, clean air, nature, culture - and Reykjavik has them in spades. Reykjavik offers both the features of a modern and innovative society and the marvellous traits of a unique natural landscape. The population of the Reykjavik Area is about 200,000. Reykjavik is spread across a peninsula offering a panoramic view of the mountains and the Atlantic Ocean from nearly every part of the city. In the summer, you can sit by the harbour at midnight and watch the sun dip slightly below the horizon before it makes its way up again.The world s northernmost capital is framed by the majestic Mt. Esja, which keeps a watchful eye on the city, and the blue waters of Faxafloi Bay. On a sunny day, the mystical Snaefellsjokull glacier towers over the western horizon, while mountainous moonscapes spread to the southeast.</descr_partner>
			<descr_work>Every year WF Iceland is hosting hundreds of international volunteers participating in projects all round the island. WF Iceland publishes a magazine called UNA where people can read about the life of the organization.In the beginning of the project volunteers will receive an introduction about the tasks - afterwards we will visit other WF workcamps located in Reykjavik. This is a great opportunity to step into different projects and even participate in their work a little bit. The group will take photos and make videos and interviews with volunteers, local hosts and people living in the area. The outcome will be published in the UNA WF magazine.At the end of the project we will prepare the final version of the magazine and publish it.</descr_work>
			<descr_accomodation_and_food>Worldwide Friends volunteers stay in one of several shared houses offering basic sleeping and cooking facilities in the heart of historical downtown Reykjavik. Volunteers need to bring their own sleeping bag and towels, but mattresses and bed linens are provided. Wireless internet access is provided free of charge, and volunteers also have free access to shared desktop computers in communal areas. The accommodation provided by Worldwide Friends Iceland for volunteers in Reykjavik is located within short walking distance of many urban amenities, including: banks, pharmacies, supermarkets, public swimming pools, restaurants, cafes, libraries, theaters, shops, museums, and bus stations.Food is included for the duration of the workcamp, however everyone is expected to do their fair share of the cooking and cleaning. Since it is always nice to try new and different dishes, volunteers are encouraged to bring along their favourite recipes from home</descr_accomodation_and_food>

			<descr_partner>Hverageroi is a small town of about 1,700 inhabitants that lies some 45 km east of Reykjavik. This friendly little community sits on top of a highly active geothermal field, which provides heat for hundreds of greenhouses where fruit, flowers and vegetables are produced throughout the year. Even bananas grow in these greenhouses The name Hverageroi means  hot springs garden.  Geothermal energy is Hverageroi s lifeblood, and you probably won t find such a natural wonder in the middle of a populated area anywhere else in the world. Nearby you will find an even more geothermally active site: Gufudalur, the lovely  Steam Valley  behind the town. This whole valley is full of hot springs, geysers, mud pots, fumaroles and steaming vents. Our host is the Rehabilitation and Health Clinic, which is a part of the Natural Health Association of Iceland.  Every year approximately 2,000 patients and other guests enjoy their diverse rehabilitation programs, which are focused on an approach that builds self-confidence and personal responsibility for the patients  own health. The Clinic has earned a solid reputation, both in Iceland and internationally, since its foundation in 1955 for personal and effective care of patients. It is the oldest and one of the two most important rehabilitation clinics in Iceland.</descr_partner>
			<descr_work>The Natural Health Association has a horticultural and environmental department, including forestry, gardening, and greenhouses, which is where Worldwide Friends volunteers work most of the time. The nature of the work depends largely on weather conditions, which can change quickly. Volunteers should bring clothes appropriate for outdoor work, but also clothes for working inside the warm greenhouses</descr_work>
			<descr_accomodation_and_food>Worldwide Friends volunteers stay in a fully equipped bungalow consisting of several double rooms. Volunteers need to bring their own sleeping bag, but mattresses are provided. Free wireless internet is available during evening hours, but volunteers need to bring their own laptops if they would like to connect to it.All meals are provided and cooked by our hosts, the Rehabilitation and Health Clinic. The menu for the project is primarily vegetarian, but two times a week it includes locally-caught fish. The food at the Rehabilitation and Health Clinic is known throughout Iceland for its high quality.</descr_accomodation_and_food>

			<descr_partner>Do you want to travel in the North of Iceland and at the same time participate in a very important project?The biggest and best known project of our organization is the  Clean Up the Coastline  (CUC) project. We have for the last six years been cleaning the coastline of Iceland and we will continue that work for the next four years, a part of this is to locate all items on the coastline which are too big to move by hands. Our volunteers are going to travel around the east of the island, they will locate the items with GPS positioning system, measure them and estimate the weight and make photos as well. The information will be put into an electronic map on our website. For the first three days the group will stay in Raufarhofn  to get information about the tasks, than they will travel around in the east for 7 days by car or hiking along the coastline and in the end of the project they will stay in Raufarhofn  for  four more days to put the information online.</descr_partner>
			<descr_work>we will do a survey for a monitoring of marine litter in several places on the coastline.We will clean certain areas (position recorded by GPS on our  CUC map ) in different parts of Iceland and collect all the trash on the beach and classify it in a standard form. We will make photos of the coastline,This project provides us the standard methodology needed to produce some serious data. At the end, we will create a scientific data useful to know more about the pollution in the oceans and on the coastline. Take a look at http://cleanupthecoastline.wordpress.com/ for more information.The marine area around Iceland is regarded as one of the cleanest of the world. Nevertheless, marine litter such as persistent organic pollutants, heavy metals or hydrocarbons is constantly contaminating Iceland s shore. A large-scale surface of the Icelandic coastline is concerned by this pollution and some beaches are even fully covered by trash, mainly caused by poorly managed landfills close by.</descr_work>
			<descr_accomodation_and_food>The group will be stay in the accommodation of our workcamps in Raufarhofn. When we are travelling we might stay in tents which will be provided by WF Iceland or in community places.The food will be provided for the duration of the work camp and everyone is expected to do their fair share of the cooking/cleaning. It would be nice to share new and different dishes, so please remember to bring along recipes from your own countries.</descr_accomodation_and_food>
			<descr_location_and_leisure>We will do some hikes in different areas in the North. In some places we will have a free entrance to the swimming pools. This camp is also On the move so you will travel a lot during the camp and see beautiful places.</descr_location_and_leisure>
			<descr_requirements>Volunteers with good computer skills, interested in scientific work and/or photographing are very much welcome to this camp. It is also important that the volunteers are in good shape because we will do a lot of hiking and outdoor activities in this camp.</descr_requirements>

			<descr_partner>The village of Raufarhofn is the community that lies farthest north in Iceland. It is located in the eastern part of Melrakkasletta close to the Arctic Circle. The population of Raufarhofn is about 200 and most of the people there earn their living from fishing and fish processing. The harbor is very beautiful and partly shaped by nature itself. A wide and untouched open area surrounds the village with a lot of birds and varied vegetation. In summer one will observe wild migratory birds within the village being a part of the village life with the villagers most often waking up in the morning to the songs of birds. The coastline with its inlets and creeks is filled with driftwood and reaches out into the Arctic Sea. Away and on the surface of the sea various sea-birds will be spotted and an occasional seal. On the beach waders strut and inland on the grassy moorlands there are dozens of lakes filled with trout. In the vicinity many species of ducks, waders and species that favor heaths and moorlands may be observed.</descr_partner>
			<descr_work>the purpose of this camp is very diverse. During these camp volunteers will be able to cooperate in different tasks. Depending to the season or month where volunteers will participate in the camp the themes will be different. WF owns a center in the village. During the first month of the summer the camp will be more focused on cultural activities for the people and the youth of the village. Activities such as cultural coffees , international evenings, workshop which volunteers can develop, renovation work such us painting and cleaning the House and visual arts project such a sharing photography knowledge s, video filming and editing. During the last 2 months of the summer volunteers will work more on environmental tasks such as cleaning the coast line. During this time the local Youth goes back to school and is more difficult to gather people for cultural evening. Another reason to avoid environmental work during the first 2 months is due to the migrant birds known as CRIA in Iceland. About this time they are nesting and is not good to disturb the areas. At the end of August the fly back again and is perfect time for coastline cleaning. Also during this time volunteers will have the chance to share photo skills and video and edit and produce visual arts materials to be use afterwards on our website.This work camp is a way to enjoy an amazing time in Iceland with other international volunteers and to have an incredible experience where participants share their knowledge with each other while they are exploring creativity, environmental issues and intercultural learning.</descr_work>

			<descr_partner>Hvalfjorour (Icelandic: Whale-fjord) is situated in the west of Iceland between Mosfellsbaer and Akranes. The fjord is approximately 30 km long and 5 km wide.The name Hvalfjorour is derived from the large number of whales which could be found and caught there. Until the 1980s, one of the biggest whaling stations in Iceland was located in this fjord. In the past the fjord also contained a large number of herring fisheries.A hiking trail to the highest waterfall in Iceland, Glymur, has its origin at the innermost end of the fjord.</descr_partner>
			<descr_work>Since the creation of Worldwide friends, the organization has been looking for the opportunity to set up a project to renovate and work at an old Icelandic farm.  The idea of renovating old spaces in the country side of Iceland and especially in areas where there isn t much population is one of the best ideas our organization could develop. In one hand we have the opportunity of giving life to an empty and old space, in the other hand we are bringing life back to the area with the spirit and the ideas of International volunteers which will be very much welcomed by the local community. The first part of this Project will consist on renovating and putting the farm in good shape. There are two building that we have to renovate. The first one is the main house where volunteers will live in the near future. The second house is the storage and workshops where volunteers will keep the paint and other materials.The work on this project is a mix of renovation work and gardening.We will also take care of the property, plant trees, cleaning the area, even cleaning the coast line around the fjord There are a lot farms in the area so the volunteers will have the chance to visit other farms around and therefore to learn about Icelandic farming methods.</descr_work>
			<descr_accomodation_and_food>We will be staying in the farm. Participants are asked to bring a sleeping bag.  Food will be provided for the duration of the workcamp and everyone is expected to do his/her fair share of the cooking/cleaning. It would be nice to try new and different dishes, so please remember to bring along recipes from your own countries.</descr_accomodation_and_food>
			<descr_location_and_leisure>We will explore the whole whale fjord and the surrounding area, including a hike to the highest waterfall in Iceland.WF Iceland will also organise reasonably-priced weekend excursions to some of the most popular, beautiful areas and natural wonders that Iceland has to offer. Excursions include unique Icelandic sights such as glacial lagoons, waterfalls, volcanic and geothermal areas, glaciers, geysirs, lava forests, hot-springs, rhyolite mountain ranges, steam-vents, or even icebergs.</descr_location_and_leisure>

			<descr_partner>Hverageroi is a small town of about 1,700 inhabitants that lies some 45 km east of Reykjavik. This friendly little community sits on top of a highly active geothermal field, which provides heat for hundreds of greenhouses where fruit, flowers and vegetables are produced throughout the year. Even bananas grow in these greenhouses The name Hverageroi means  hot springs garden.  Geothermal energy is Hverageroi s lifeblood, and you probably won t find such a natural wonder in the middle of a populated area anywhere else in the world. Nearby you will find an even more geothermally active site: Gufudalur, the lovely  Steam Valley  behind the town. This whole valley is full of hot springs, geysers, mud pots, fumaroles and steaming vents. Our host is the Rehabilitation and Health Clinic, which is a part of the Natural Health Association of Iceland. Every year approximately 2,000 patients and other guests enjoy their diverse rehabilitation programs, which are focused on an approach that builds self-confidence and personal responsibility for the patients  own health. The Clinic has earned a solid reputation, both in Iceland and internationally, since its foundation in 1955 for personal and effective care of patients. It is the oldest and one of the two most important rehabilitation clinics in Iceland.</descr_partner>
			<descr_work>The Natural Health Association has a horticultural and environmental department, including forestry, gardening, and greenhouses, which is where Worldwide Friends volunteers work most of the time. The nature of the work depends largely on weather conditions, which can change quickly. Volunteers should bring clothes appropriate for outdoor work, but also clothes for working inside the warm greenhouses.</descr_work>
			<descr_accomodation_and_food>Worldwide Friends volunteers stay in a fully equipped bungalow consisting of several double rooms. Volunteers need to bring their own sleeping bag, but mattresses are provided. Free wireless internet is available during evening hours, but volunteers need to bring their own laptops if they would like to connect to it. All meals are provided and cooked by our hosts, the Rehabilitation and Health Clinic. The menu for the project is primarily vegetarian, but two times a week it includes locally-caught fish. The food at the Rehabilitation and Health Clinic is known throughout Iceland for its high quality.</descr_accomodation_and_food>

			<descr_partner>Scoured by Ice Age glaciers, the dramatic east coast boasts long, narrow fjords with steep sides and jagged peaks which contrast with inland fertile farmlands. Natural harbors mean picture-postcard fishing villages and seemingly never-ending roads cross the region, providing beautiful sweeping views.  Fjaroabyggo  is an association of villages in the Eastern fjords of Iceland. It includes the towns of Eskifjorour, Faskruosfjorour, Mjoifjorour, Neskaupstaour, Reyoarfjorour and Stoovarfjorour, all tiny fishing villages with steep mountains towering just behind the houses. In this area you will see some of the features that make Iceland a unique place in the world: spectacular fjords with a rich sea life, a great variety of bird life, and countless breathtaking hiking paths. You will explore the area during your stay in the east.</descr_partner>

			<descr_partner>Reykjavik is a city full of energy, just waiting for you to experience it. Powered by heat from the earth below, with ever-changing weather sweeping across the landscape, its natural features are matched by the energy of its residents. Think of the qualities of a great city - fun, culture, nature, clean air - and Reykjavik has them in spades. All the advantages of a modern, forward-looking society are complemented by the beautiful natural setting. In a country of only just over 300,000 people, the Reykjavik Capital Area has a population of about 200,000. However, since it s the only major city in the country, Reykjavik has a lot of the amenities that you would only expect to find in a much larger center elsewhere in the world.Reykjavik is the world s northernmost capital city and is centered on the Seltjarnarnes Peninsula. Come at the right time of year, and in favorable conditions you will see the city s skyline silhouetted against the glowing, shimmering curtain of the aurora borealis, also known as the northern lights. Reykjavik is framed by the majestic Mt. Esja and the blue waters of Faxafloi Bay to the north, while rugged lava-fields spread to the southeast. On a clear sunny day, the Snaefellsjokull glacier glitters on the western horizon like a crystal.</descr_partner>

A top priority of the park is to protect the natural environment, promote local sustainable development, introduce local culture and place a strong emphasis on nature tourism.Katla Geopark got its name from one of its most known volcanoes, Katla which is under the glacier Mirdalsjokull. The geopark is 9542 km2 or around 9,3  of the total area of Iceland with population around 2700.Katla Geopark is in every sense the land of ice and fire, with its towering glaciers and active volcanoes. These forces have been shaping the land for thousands of years and the nearest examples of that are the powerful eruptions in Eyjafjallajokull 2010 and Grimsvotn 2011. But there is also more amazing landscapes in the area, mountains, lakes, black sandy beaches, green pastures and meadows, powerful glacial rivers, beautiful waterfalls and vast lava fields.Katla Geopark is accessible all year round, and each season has its own magical charm in this spectacular natural paradise.Vik in Mirdalur is Iceland s most southerly village, bordered by the glacial river Jokulsa to the west and the river Blautakvisl to the east. It s northern border is the Mirdalsjokull glacier, which caps the volcanic Mt. Katla, while its southern limits are black sands and the rolling Atlantic waves. The district lives mainly by agriculture. Although this community of 600 inhabitants faces the open Atlantic, Vik is the only seaside settlement in Iceland left without a harbour due to natural circumstances. The natural beauty of the area is spectacular. Just east of the village s outskirts lies one of Europe s biggest arctic tern breeding grounds. South of Vik is a beautiful beach, which is one of the world s ten best island beaches . A short hike within the close vicinity of Vik is sure to satisfy all serious nature lovers and bird watchers. Vik and its surroundings is one of the main bird life areas in Iceland.</descr_partner>

			<descr_partner>Hverageroi is a small town of about 1,700 inhabitants that lies some 45 km east of Reykjavik. This friendly little community sits on top of a highly active geothermal field, which provides heat for hundreds of greenhouses where fruit, flowers and vegetables are produced throughout the year. Even bananas grow in these greenhouses The name Hverageroi means  hot springs garden.  Geothermal energy is Hverageroi s lifeblood, and you probably won t find such a natural wonder in the middle of a populated area anywhere else in the world. Nearby you will find an even more geothermally active site: Gufudalur, the lovely  Steam Valley  behind the town. This whole valley is full of hot springs, geysers, mud pots, fumaroles and steaming vents. Our host is the Rehabilitation and Health Clinic, which is a part of the Natural Health Association of Iceland.  Every year approximately 2,000 patients and other guests enjoy their diverse rehabilitation programs, which are focused on an approach that builds self-confidence and personal responsibility for the patients  own health. The Clinic has earned a solid reputation, both in Iceland and internationally, since its foundation in 1955 for personal and effective care of patients. It is the oldest and one of the two most important rehabilitation clinics in Iceland.</descr_partner>
			<descr_work>The Natural Health Association has a horticultural and environmental department, including forestry, gardening, and greenhouses, which is where Worldwide Friends volunteers work most of the time.

			<descr_partner>This camp will take place in a small community called Grimsnes- and Grafningshreppur which is located in the middle of the south area of Iceland. In the area you can find some of the historical places in Iceland i for example   Singvellirwhich  is by far Iceland s most famous historic site. The Alsingi, or general assembly, first met there in AD930, and continued to do so for nearly nine centuries, until 1798. Various important events in the Icelandic Sagas took place at Singvellir, and in 1930 it was declared a National Park. In 2004 Singvellir was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List.Nowhere on earth is the junction between the European and American tectonic plates in the Earth s crust as clear as in the southwest, and at Singvellir: the plates diverge here by as much as 2 cm per year. But the gap is constantly being filled, as volcanoes have been erupting regularly throughout Iceland s history.Not far away is the old episcopal seat of Skalholt, which was the centre of the church and Christianity in Iceland from the mid-11th century until the end of the 18th.But the region has other attractions: places of outstanding natural beauty include magnificent waterfalls, of which Gullfoss (Golden Falls) is the best known. In many geothermal areas villages have grown up, where exotic fruits and vegetables are grown in greenhouses heated by hot springs.The best known hot spring is Geysir, from which derives the English word   geyser  for spouting hot springs: the big Geysir is surrounded by many more springs of all shapes and sizes.A little further east are two of Iceland s most active volcanoes. Mt. Hekla has erupted about 20 times in Icelandic history, and Mt. Katla, under the Mirdalsjokull glacier, is almost as active. Many years have now passed since Mt. Katla last erupted, and according to geoscientists it is overdue for another burst of activity.</descr_partner>
			<descr_work>The volunteers will be working with the environmental department of the community. Most of the work will consist of planting trees and taking care of the environment in the surrounding area.Our work will also depend on weather conditions and that s why we have to be flexible.

			<descr_partner>The village of Raufarhofn is the community that lies farthest north in Iceland. It is located in the eastern part of Melrakkasletta close to the Arctic Circle. The population of Raufarhofn is about 200 and most of the people there earn their living from fishing and fish processing. The harbor is very beautiful and partly shaped by nature itself. A wide and untouched open area surrounds the village with a lot of birds and varied vegetation. In summer one will observe wild migratory birds within the village being a part of the village life with the villagers most often waking up in the morning to the songs of birds. The coastline with its inlets and creeks is filled with driftwood and reaches out into the Arctic Sea. Away and on the surface of the sea various sea-birds will be spotted and an occasional seal. On the beach waders strut and inland on the grassy moorlands there are dozens of lakes filled with trout. In the vicinity many species of ducks, waders and species that favor heaths and moorlands may be observed.</descr_partner>
			<descr_work>the purpose of this camp is very diverse. During these camp volunteers will be able to cooperate in different tasks. Depending to the season or month where volunteers will participate in the camp the themes will be different. WF owns a center in the village. During the first month of the summer the camp will be more focused on cultural activities for the people and the youth of the village. Activities such as cultural coffees , international evenings, workshop which volunteers can develop, renovation work such us painting and cleaning the House and visual arts project such a sharing photography knowledge s, video filming and editing. During the last 2 months of the summer volunteers will work more on environmental tasks such as cleaning the coast line. During this time the local Youth goes back to school and is more difficult to gather people for cultural evening. Another reason to avoid environmental work during the first 2 months is due to the migrant birds known as CRIA in Iceland. About this time they are nesting and is not good to disturb the areas. At the end of August the fly back again and is perfect time for coastline cleaning. Also during this time volunteers will have the chance to share photo skills and video and edit and produce visual arts materials to be use afterwards on our website.This work camp is a way to enjoy an amazing time in Iceland with other international volunteers and to have an incredible experience where participants share their knowledge with each other while they are exploring creativity, environmental issues and intercultural learning.</descr_work>
